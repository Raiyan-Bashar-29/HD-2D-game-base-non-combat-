## Content gate: the checks that catch a broken item, a duplicate object id, or a localization
## key that will render on screen as its own name.
##
## ITS SIBLING IS tools/check_boundary.gd, which asks the opposite question: this tool checks
## that the DEMO is well formed, that one checks that the ENGINE does not know the demo exists.
## Both must exit 0. They were one tool for about ten minutes, until check_budgets.gd refused
## the result at 252 of the 250 allowed code lines.
##
## RUN:  godot_console --headless --script tools/check_content.gd
## Exit 0 if clean, 1 on any violation. Safe in a commit hook next to check_budgets.gd.
##
## WHY IT CAN BE A --script TOOL AT ALL
## Because ItemDefinition and ItemDb touch no autoload. Under --headless --script the autoload
## *identifiers* do not resolve, so the moment anyone adds a Log call to a content class, this
## tool stops compiling and the gate fails. That is a real mechanical enforcement of the
## content-layer rule, not a style note. print() is used here for the same reason.
##
## WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
## Computed localization keys. interact_prompt.gd builds "verb.%s" and "refusal.%s" from enum
## names at runtime, and no text scan can follow that. Those are covered by an enum loop in
## tests/unit/items_test.gd, which is better verification than a scan could be. It also cannot
## report unused CSV keys, for the same reason: a key referenced only by computed name would
## look orphaned. And it is not a general hard-coded-string audit - telling a player-facing
## literal from a log message or a flag key needs semantics a text scan does not have, and a
## partial tool that looks complete is how 409 passing checks happened.
##
## MUST NOT: import a gameplay or ui class, or reference an autoload.

## THE ONE FLAG NAMESPACE THIS TOOL DOES VALIDATE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A CONTRADICTION.
## Every other flag a quest names is PRINTED and not judged, for the reason above: a flag can be
## written from a scene, a conversation, a path action or at runtime, so failing on one with no
## findable writer would be wrong most times it fired. `bag/<carrier>/<item id>` is different in
## the one way that matters - IT HAS EXACTLY ONE WRITER, `Inventory._publish`, and half of the
## key is an item id that this tool can look up. So the two mistakes that produce a step nobody
## can ever finish are catchable here, and both are silent everywhere else:
##
##   - AN ITEM NO CATALOGUE HAS. The flag stays absent forever, the count reads zero, and the
##     objective sits in the journal for the rest of the game. A misspelled item id in a quest
##     is exactly as invisible as the misspelled `locked_key` WP-09 found.
##   - A COUNT OF ZERO, or a test that is not a count. `AT_LEAST 0` passes with an empty bag, so
##     the step is unconditional while READING as an errand; a bag flag under IS_TRUE is worse,
##     because `get_bool` on an int warns and answers false, so the step never passes at all.
##
## The carrier is NOT validated: a carrier id is an `@export` on a node in a scene this tool
## does not open, and a game may put a bag on an NPC or a stash. That omission is stated rather
## than papered over, which is the same line `_all_waypoint_names` draws.

## Areas on the world map get the same treatment as every other catalogue, plus the check no text
## scan can do: every name_key must exist in the CSV, or a dot on the map is labelled with its own

## question about a map this tool has never seen the size of, and a checker that guessed would be
## the partial check that looks complete.
##
## THAT THE AREA HAS A SCENE IS NOT CHECKED HERE, and the omission is the same one `area_def.gd`
## states: the id becomes a path through `Director.AREA_PATH_TEMPLATE`, the one place that knows
