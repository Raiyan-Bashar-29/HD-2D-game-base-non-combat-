class_name PlayerController
extends CharacterBody3D
## The player's body and movement.
##
## INPUT OWNERSHIP: this reads movement input only. Interaction input is read by
## InteractionSensor, which is a sibling component, because routing it through here would
## force this file to know about interaction - which the MUST NOT line below forbids.
##
## OWNS: the player's position, velocity, gait and movement state.
## MUST NOT: know about dialogue, inventory, interaction rules or the camera. It reacts to
## a small number of signals that say "you are busy now" and otherwise minds its own
## business. This is what stops a player controller becoming the second god object.
##
## MOVEMENT IS CAMERA-RELATIVE: pressing up moves away from the camera regardless of where
## the camera is, which is what players expect and what makes a fixed-angle camera feel
## natural instead of maddening.
##
## NO JUMPING, deliberately. In an exploration game with a fixed camera, a free jump makes
## the player try to reach ledges the level was not built for, and every collision gap
## becomes a bug report. Vertical movement is authored instead: a ClimbPoint asks this body
## to move between two markers, via begin_climb() at the bottom of this file.
## The gravity below is for slopes and falling, not for jumping.

## Which character's attributes this body is subject to. Deliberately a SECOND export beside
## `Equipment.wearer_id` rather than one shared between them: this file must keep working with
## no equipment component under it at all, and a controller that read its id off a sibling
## would break the moment a game shipped a character who carries nothing.

## THE ONE ATTRIBUTE THIS FILE READS, and its name is declared HERE rather than in `Attributes`
## on purpose: an attribute's name belongs to whatever consumes it, so an attribute nothing
## reads has nowhere to be written down. That is what stops the container growing a table of
## declared-and-unread names, which is the failure this package was split out of WP-09 to
## avoid. `attr/<character_id>/pace` scales every gait at once, so a slower character sneaks,
## walks and runs slower rather than acquiring a fourth speed nobody tuned.
