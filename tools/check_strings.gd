## THIS IS THE "HARD-CODED-STRING AUDIT" WP-14 ASKED FOR, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE ONE
## check_content.gd REFUSED. That file's header says a general audit needs "semantics a text
## scan does not have", and it is right: nothing in a line of text says whether "world" is a log
## category, a flag namespace or a sentence meant for a player. So this tool does not guess. It
## checks the two things a scan really can see, and both are anchored at a SINK or at a
## DECLARATION rather than by inspecting a literal and wondering what it is for.
##
## MUST NOT: load a content class, instantiate a scene, or reference an autoload. Same reason as
## check_boundary.gd — it is pure text, so it keeps working in a checkout whose data/ has been
## deleted, which is the state a new game starts in.

## `placeholder_text` on LineEdit, `title` on Window. Matched with a trailing " = " so
## `text_direction` and `text_overrun_behavior`, which are enums and not text, are not swept in.

## CHECK ONE — THE SINK RULE, and why it is a sink rule rather than a literal rule.
##
## Non-negotiable #3 is "no player-facing string literals", and the reason check_content.gd
## refused a general audit is that a literal cannot be classified by looking at it. A SINK can:
## whatever reaches `.text` is on the screen by construction, whatever its content. So the rule
## is
##
##     the right-hand side of a text assignment either passes through tr(), or contains no
##     string literal at all
##
## which is checkable, has no false positives on the sinks in the project today, and never
## requires the tool to have an opinion about an individual string.
## `label.text = text_value` passes because it holds no literal;
## `button.text = tr(A if held else B).format({"item": x})` passes on the tr(), which is what
## makes the `.format()` dictionary key harmless rather than something the scan must parse.
##
## WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody reads a green run as more than it is:
##   - a literal that reaches a sink through a VARIABLE assigned on an earlier line
##   - a sink outside src/*.gd, so a .tscn authoring `text = "Play"` directly is not scanned
##   - a literal handed to an API that draws text without going through a property:
##     draw_string(), set_tooltip_text(), an OS dialog
##   - whether the key tr() was handed is the RIGHT key. A wrong key that exists renders the
##     wrong sentence, which is gotcha 2's shape and is not a text-scan problem

## CHECK TWO — EVERY KEY DECLARED IN CODE EXISTS, and this is the half with teeth.
##
## 67 `*_KEY` consts under src/ name a CSV row, and nothing checked any of them until now:
## check_content.gd validates the keys authored in .tres content, and the enum loop in
## tests/unit/items_test.gd covers the two COMPUTED families (verb.*, refusal.*). A const key
## sat in neither. A typo in one renders the raw key on screen — `notify.item_takne` — which is
## gotcha 2's shape in its least visible form, because tr() returning its own argument is not an
## error and every rung stays green over it.
##
## A key holding `%` is a PATTERN completed at runtime (`weather.%s`), which no text scan can
## follow. It is COUNTED AND PRINTED rather than silently skipped, on check_boundary.gd's
## precedent: a gate that quietly ignores part of its input reads as a gate that covered
## everything.
