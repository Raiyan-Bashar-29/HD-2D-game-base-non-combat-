## The world clock. Autoload `Clock`.
##
## WHY A CLOCK IS FOUNDATIONAL
## Time is an input to lighting, NPC schedules, ambience, shop hours, weather odds and some
## interactions. If each of those keeps its own notion of "night", they drift apart. One clock
## emits the truth and everything else listens.
##
## AND WHY IT ALSO PUBLISHES ONTO THE FLAG SURFACE
## Emitting a signal serves a listener that has CODE. Authored content has none: a dialogue
## condition and a quest step both go through `FlagQuery`, which reads `Flags` and nothing else.
## So until T5.31 no authored condition in this template could mention time at all — including
## the shop hours the paragraph above names as a reason a clock is foundational. The truth still
## lives here and nowhere else; a derived copy is PUBLISHED so it can be asked about, and
## `Flags.declare_derived` keeps every key out of the save file, so the day is stored once, by
## this file, in this file's own format.
##
## OWNS: the current day, hour and minute; the rate time passes; the time-of-day phase; and
## publishing all of those into the `time/` flag namespace.
## MUST NOT: change lighting, move an NPC, play a sound, or READ a flag it published — a
## projection that is also an input is a loop. It reports time passing. What that means is the
## listener's business. This is the boundary that keeps a day/night system from quietly turning
## into the place where all world logic lives.
##
## RATE: at the default 1.0 seconds per in-game minute, a full 24-hour day takes 24 real
## minutes. That is deliberately brisk, so a play session sees several dawns.

const MINUTES_PER_HOUR: int = 60
const HOURS_PER_DAY: int = 24
const MINUTES_PER_DAY: int = MINUTES_PER_HOUR * HOURS_PER_DAY

## THE DERIVED FLAG NAMESPACE THIS CLOCK OWNS, WHOLE. Declared derived in `_ready`, so nothing
## under it is written to a save; a consuming game must not put a flag of its own here.
const FLAG_PREFIX: String = "time/"
## ORDERED ints, which is why they are ints: `AT_LEAST 9` with `AT_MOST 17` is a shop's opening
## hours, and an ordering comparison on an hour means what an author expects it to mean.
const FLAG_DAY: StringName = &"time/day"
const FLAG_HOUR: StringName = &"time/hour"
## A phase is published as ONE BOOL UNDER ITS OWN NAME, never as an ordinal. `_publish_phase`
## carries the two measurements that settled that, and they are the reason this is not
## `time/phase` holding a number.
const PHASE_PREFIX: String = "time/phase/"

## THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `time/minute`. A minute is a CONTINUOUS quantity for interpolating
## something — `day_fraction` is what a lighting gradient samples — not a question an authored
## format asks; and publishing it would rewrite a flag 1,440 times a day, and announce it on
## `flag_changed` 1,440 times, to answer a question nobody put. An hour is already the
## granularity `NpcSchedule.entry_for_hour` runs on.

## Real seconds per in-game minute. Set to 0 to freeze time without pausing the game.

## A PHASE IS A NAME, NOT A NUMBER, AND TWO MEASUREMENTS SETTLED THAT RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE.
##
## The obvious shape is `time/phase` holding the `GameEnums.DayPhase` ordinal, read with `EQUALS`.
## It was rejected twice over:
##
## 1. ORDINALS ARE A STORAGE FORMAT, NOT A MEANING. `GameEnums` is append-only precisely because
##    its ordinals live inside authored `.tscn` and `.tres` files, so inserting a phase would
##    silently re-point every authored condition at its neighbour — a content migration with no
##    parse error to announce it.
## 2. AND ORDERING ON A PHASE IS ALREADY MEANINGLESS, WHICH IS THE SHARPER HALF. Running
##    `phase_for_hour` across a day gives ordinals 6,6,6,6,6,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5
##    — DEEP_NIGHT is the HIGHEST ordinal and the EARLIEST hours, because a day wraps and an enum
##    does not. So `AT_LEAST DUSK` would hold at 00:00 and fail at 06:00. The only sound question
##    about a phase is equality, whatever the numbering.
##
## SO WHY NOT THE STRING NAME. Because a String flag is UNREADABLE by the one evaluator, and that
## was measured too: `FlagQuery.passes` on a flag holding "DUSK" returns FALSE for every test in
## the closed set — `EQUALS` and `IS_TRUE` both, each logging `expected int` / `expected bool` —
## since the set compares bools and ints and nothing else. Publishing a name would have shipped
## four flags no authored condition could read, while looking exactly right.
##
## A BOOL UNDER THE NAME IS BOTH: stable against an enum insertion, and readable through
## `IS_TRUE` / `IS_FALSE` with no seventh comparison added to a set whose own file says it stays
## closed. EXACTLY ONE EXISTS AT A TIME, and it is ERASED rather than set false — `Inventory`
## erases a spent stack rather than zeroing it, and an absent flag answers `IS_TRUE` false and
## `IS_FALSE` true, so the query semantics are identical and the store stays one row per phase
## instead of seven. The erase comes FIRST: a phase flag left true would make an authored
## dawn-only line fire at every hour after the first dawn, which is the whole defect this guards.
