class_name Quest
extends Resource
## One quest, as authored data: what it is called, when it starts, and its steps in order.
##
## THE ID IS THE FILE NAME. `data/quests/roses.tres` must declare `id = &"quest/roses"`.
## `QuestDb` refuses any quest where the two disagree and names both, so a copy-paste slip is a
## loud startup problem rather than a quest that silently never exists. The `quest/` prefix
## makes a save file self-describing, the same way `item/` does.
##
## IT STARTS ON A FLAG CONDITION, WHICH IS WHY NOTHING HAS TO OFFER IT. A conversation that
## writes `met/gardener` starts a quest that tests it, and the conversation has never heard of
## the quest system - exactly the shape a trigger volume already has, where the trigger never
## names its consequence. So "a quest given by an NPC", "a quest that begins when you enter a
## place" and "a quest unlocked by chapter three" are all one mechanism and no code.
##
## A COMPLETED QUEST GRANTS NOTHING, DELIBERATELY. It emits `Events.quest_completed` and stops.
## The alternative - a `reward_item` field - would put the `gameplay` layer (Inventory, and a
## player to give it to) inside a `systems`-layer tracker, and `src/` points downward only.
## Anything that wants to hand over an item, open a gate or start the next chapter listens to
## the signal, which is the same reasoning that keeps `Weather` from drawing rain.
##
## STEPS ARE ORDERED AND WALKED FRONT TO BACK. There is no branching and no failure state: this
## is the template's one shallow proof that a quest system exists, and a branching quest wants a
## graph, a failure policy and a UI for both. `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md` carries the row.
##
## OWNS: the immutable data of one quest, and validating its own fields.
## MUST NOT: read a flag, track progress, grant a reward, or touch an autoload - for the reason
## in quest_step.gd's header, which is a build gate rather than a preference.

## Globally unique, and equal to `quest/` plus this resource's file name.
