## 2026-08-25 — Work sliced into one-chat packages, and a roadmap to skeleton-complete

**Did:**

No gameplay code. Added `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md`: fifteen packages from here to
skeleton-complete, in dependency order, each sized to one chat and each naming the exact files
that chat should read. Wired it into all four entry points — `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
`docs/CONTEXT.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` — and put the per-chat open/close protocol in
`CLAUDE.md`, since that is the file a new session reads automatically.

**Why:**

A chat context window is the binding constraint on this project. This session hit usage limits
three times, and twice a delegated fan-out died mid-flight after burning several hundred
thousand tokens. Work has to be sliced so one chat finishes one coherent part.

The structure was already fine — `src/core` is 590 code lines, `src/systems` 725,
`src/gameplay` 867, `src/ui` 117 — and the downward-only layer rule means a package never has
to read upward. **The missing piece was not structure, it was a manifest.** A new session had
no way to know which subset to load, so it loaded too much. Every package now carries an
explicit file list, which is the load-bearing part of the whole document.

Also settled what "skeleton complete" means, because the phrase was doing a lot of unexamined
work: every system on the inventory has a working minimal implementation plus one piece of
placeholder content proving it. That is the standard items were held to — three throwaway
`.tres` files proved the pattern and the fiftieth item needs no code. After that point,
everything remaining is content.

**Connects:**

The board is the executable version of `ROADMAP.md`, and that file now says so, so the two
cannot silently drift. Dependency order is recorded with reasons rather than left implicit —
UI foundation before any screen, because a screen built first forces an ad-hoc pause and a
boolean per screen; dialogue before quests and path actions, because both are driven by it;
world map after a second area exists, because it is meaningless with one.

WP-15 carries a specific obligation: it must settle ADR-0006's open question. Items are found
by scanning a directory, verified in the editor and headless only, and the export preset must
export *all* resources or the catalogue ships empty.

**Decisions taken with the owner:** all four optional systems are IN the skeleton — path
actions, traversal equipment, world map and fast travel, crafting and gathering. Nothing on
the inventory is cut. Narrative systems are built against placeholder story; the real story is
content, supplied later.

**Verified:**

Docs-only, so the ladder is a regression check rather than a proof: boot `0 warnings, 0
errors`, tests 165 passed / 0 failed, `check_content` PASS. Every entry point references the
board.

**Unblocks:**

WP-01, triggers and traversal, in a fresh chat: trigger volumes (the folder, the collision
layer and the inventory row all exist and nothing populates them), a rest point with
`Clock.skip_to_hour`, and climb points — the authored vertical movement that "no jumping"
implies.

**Known gaps:**

Packages 02 through 15 are specified at goal-plus-manifest depth, not to WP-01's detail. That
is deliberate: writing detailed plans for work fourteen chats away is exactly the speculative
architecture this project keeps deleting. Each gets its detail when it comes up.

## 2026-08-25 — Items, inventory, pickups and chests: the demo loop closes

**Did:**

Planned this one properly before writing anything, because the last two attempts at
delegating research both died on usage limits. Two Explore agents mined the three surviving
audit reports and verified the existing seams; one design agent produced an implementation
plan; the whole thing was settled with the owner before line one. That paid for itself twice
over, below.

Shipped in two commits. First, prerequisites (`dd90da0`):

- **Layer order corrected.** The declared order put `content` *above* `gameplay`, but a
  `Pickup` must reference an `ItemDefinition` — an upward dependency failing ADR-0001's own
  test. Content is data, not a consumer: `core -> content -> systems -> gameplay -> ui`.
  Recorded as an ADR-0001 amendment rather than quietly fixed.
- **Signal payloads.** `notify_requested` had no substitution slot, so a toast could not say
  "Taken: Rose Key", and `interaction_refused` could not name the missing item. Both now carry
  a `Dictionary`; both had zero emitters, so it was free then and expensive later.
- **Per-section save versions.** `register()` takes a version, sections store as
  `{"v": n, "data": {…}}`, and appliers migrate themselves. One envelope version would have
  forced `_migrate` to understand every section — the god object via the back door.
- **`Flags` hands out deep copies** from `get_dict`/`get_array`. Godot passes Dictionaries by
  reference, so returning the stored object let a caller mutate world state without
  `set_flag`, meaning `flag_changed` never fired.
- **Test suite split** into `tests/framework/test_case.gd` plus `tests/unit/*.gd`, because the
  runner was at 184 of its 250 lines and the item cases would not fit. Raising the budget is
  the exemption the checker's own header forbids.

Then the feature:

- **`ItemDefinition`** — the project's first `Resource`. Four fields: `id`, `name_key`,
  `category`, `max_stack`. Five more were cut (`icon`, `description_key`, `value`, `tags`,
  `world_scene`) because nothing displays or reads them and adding one later edits one script
  while leaving every `.tres` valid.
- **`ItemDb`** — a static class, not an autoload, that scans `data/items`. ADR-0006.
- **`Inventory`** — a component on the player, with `can_accept()` as the single capacity seam.
- **`Pickup`**, **`ItemContainer`**, and `Gate.requires_item`.
- **`tools/check_content.gd`** — duplicate object ids, id/filename mismatches, localization keys
  missing from the CSV, and `ItemDefinition` files filed outside `data/items`.
- Courtyard content: a rose key on the dais, a wicker chest, an east gate that wants the key.

**Why:**

Items had to be next because they were the last missing piece of the Phase 1 loop *and* the
project's first typed `Resource`. `ARCHITECTURE.md` has claimed since day one that "adding the
fiftieth item must not touch a single line of code", and that claim had never been exercised —
the audit called it unrunnable rather than untested. It is now tested by a case that counts the
`.tres` files on disk instead of hard-coding three, so adding a fourth item keeps it passing.

Two design points worth keeping. **The inventory is not an autoload**: interactables are already
handed the interactor by `attempt(who)`, so `Inventory.of(who)` needs no global and works for an
NPC or a stash, whereas a global would hard-code "one bag in the universe" into every
interactable in the game. **The lever and the gate still know nothing about each other** — one
publishes a flag, the other reads one, and now a third thing can demand a carried item instead.

**Connects:**

Persistence added *zero* new machinery. `PersistentState.store(&"taken", true)` writes
`obj/<area>/<object>/taken` into `Flags`, which is already a tested save participant, so a
pickup that is gone stays gone because `flags` is applied before the area is even requested.
That is the whole return on ADR-0005. `Pickup` deliberately does not free itself — the sensor
may hold a reference inside the very call that took the item — it goes unavailable,
unmonitorable and invisible instead.

**Verified:**

- Type gate clean on every new script; `--import` clean.
- Boot: courtyard with **6 interactables**, `0 warnings, 0 errors`.
- Tests: **165 passed, 0 failed**, exit 0, no leaked instances. A deliberately broken
  assertion exits 1.
- `check_budgets`: 44 files, 3,202 code lines, **0 violations**.
- `check_content`: PASS — and proven to fail. A scratch copy with a mismatched item id, a
  duplicate `object_id`, a misspelled localization key and a stray definition produced four
  precise `file:line` violations and exit 1.
- Visual capture at 10:15 shows the placeholder-marker key on the dais and the chest, both
  casting shadows, with the localized prompt reading "Read  Weathered Notice".

**Two things the planning caught that would have cost real time:**

1. **`class_name Container` does not compile.** `Container` is a native Godot class (the
   `Control` base), so it would have cascaded into every subclass as "could not resolve class" —
   the same trap as `Area3D.priority`. Verified against the engine's own class list, and the
   chest is `ItemContainer`.
2. **Resource-typed `@export` from a hand-authored `.tscn` works** with no `node_paths` header,
   unlike Node-typed ones. Probed before authoring any prefab against the assumption.

And one bug the refactor caught in its own new helper: a one-step `spawn()` added nodes to the
tree before the caller could set `object_id`, which `Interactable` forwards in `_enter_tree` —
so it arrived too late and persistence silently died. Split into `build()` and `attach()` so the
ordering lives in the API rather than a comment.

**Unblocks:**

Trigger volumes and a rest point, then the screen stack that the inventory UI needs. Phase 1's
remaining exit criteria are now the walk-and-face check and a real save/quit/relaunch.

**Known gaps:**

**The export path is unproven** and this matters: items are found by scanning a directory,
verified in the editor and headless only. There is no export preset, and it must export *all*
resources or the catalogue ships empty — written up in ADR-0006 rather than left as a surprise.
No trigger volumes yet, no screen of any kind, no item instances (deferred until something has
durability), no equipment. The sprite sheet layout is still two hardcoded constants. Only one
area exists, so the transition code has still never swapped two.

---

## 2026-08-24 — Object identity, and the interaction loop end to end

**Did:**

- **ADR-0005: authored object identity.** Every persistent object carries a `PersistentState`
  child with an `object_id`, unique within its area. State is written through `Flags` under
  `obj/<area_id>/<object_id>/<field>`. Rejected node-path identity, which is free but couples
  identity to scene structure: renaming a node silently orphans its state, the chest refills,
  and nothing errors. Rejected generated UUIDs as unreadable in a save file and in a diff.
  No new autoload — `Flags` is already a generic store and already a tested save participant.
- **`Interactable`**, a deliberately shallow base class over `Area3D`. Subclasses override
  `refusal()` and `perform()`; detection, ranking, prompts, refusal messaging, one-shot
  handling and hold-to-confirm are all handled once. Chose a base class over a duck-typed
  component because warnings-as-errors forbids calling a method on an untyped value, so a
  component would need a cast at every call site.
- **`InteractionSensor`** on the player. Ranks candidates by authored priority, then
  proximity, then how squarely the player faces the target, with ties broken by node name so
  physics callback order cannot reshuffle the prompt between frames. Tab cycles overlapping
  targets. Hold-to-confirm is supported and drawn as a progress bar.
- **Three interactables:** `Readable` (signs), `Lever` (toggles a persistent flag), `Gate`
  (refuses with a reason until a flag is set, then opens and stays open).
- **Localized UI:** `InteractPrompt` and `NotificationToast`, plus `localization/strings.csv`
  with 28 keys wired through `tr()`. This closes the "zero `tr()` calls" audit finding —
  there is now no code path by which raw player-facing text reaches the screen.
- Placed a notice, a lever and a north gate in the courtyard as instanced prefabs from
  `scenes/objects/`.

**Why:**

The audit named object identity as the thing blocking everything else, because interaction,
items, containers and doors all persist state through it, and retrofitting it means touching
every scene. It had to be decided before content existed.

The lever deliberately does not know what it opens. The tempting design is
`@export var door_to_open`, which couples every lever to one consequence; the second time a
lever needs to do two things, the coupling has to be undone. The lever owns a flag and
anything may watch it, so one lever can gate five things without knowing they exist.

Refusal is a first-class result rather than a hidden prompt. Hiding the prompt on a locked
gate is cheaper but worse: the player cannot tell a locked door from scenery, so they never
learn there is something to come back for.

**Connects:**

`PersistentState` walks up to the enclosing `AreaRoot` for its namespace, so an id only has to
be unique within one area file. `Interactable` forwards `object_id` to that child in
`_enter_tree`, which runs top-down before any child `_ready`, so an instanced prefab sets its
identity with one root-level property override instead of a child-node edit that hand-authored
`.tscn` files cannot express robustly. Interaction input is read by the sensor, not by
`PlayerController`, because the controller's own MUST NOT line forbids it knowing about
interaction; the comment claiming "one of only two scripts allowed to read input" was corrected.

**Verified:**

- Type gate clean on all eight new scripts.
- `--headless --import` clean; boot loads the courtyard with 3 interactables,
  **0 warnings, 0 errors**.
- Test suite **74 passed, 0 failed**, exit 0. The new cases drive the whole loop with no
  simulated keypress: the gate is offered and refuses with LOCKED, the lever publishes its
  flag, the same gate then opens, its state lands at `obj/global/t_gate/open`, and after the
  node is freed and re-instantiated it is *still open* — which is what an area reload does.
  Clearing one object's state leaves unrelated flags intact.
- `check_budgets.gd` — 32 files, 2,485 code lines, 0 violations. It caught one of these very
  test functions at 42 lines against the 40 limit; the function was split rather than the
  budget raised.
- Visual capture at 09:30 shows the prompt reading "Read  Weathered Notice", both words
  resolved through the translation table.

**Unblocks:**

Items and inventory, which is the last big piece of the demo loop, and which will be the first
typed `Resource` content class — the thing that finally tests the "adding the fiftieth item
touches no code" claim.

**Known gaps:**

Still zero typed `Resource` content classes. No duplicate-`object_id` detection, so two objects
sharing an id inside one area would silently share state; a content validator scanning scenes
would catch it. No hard-coded-string audit, so the localization rule is enforced by discipline
rather than mechanically. Trigger volumes still have a folder, a collision layer and no system.
The gate opens but leads nowhere, because there is only one area.

Two engine traps cost time and are now recorded in `CONTEXT.md`: `Area3D` already defines
`priority`, and redefining it is a parse error that cascades into every subclass as "could not
resolve class"; and `set_anchors_preset()` leaves offsets at zero, producing a zero-size
Control whose text spills off the screen.

## 2026-08-24 — Audit: four defects fixed, and rung 4 of the ladder made real

**Did:**

Audited the Phase 0 skeleton, fixed every confirmed defect, and built the test suite.

- **Toggle-run did nothing.** `_is_running()` polled `Input.is_action_just_pressed` and is
  called twice per frame (from `_current_speed()` and `_update_state()`), so the toggle
  flipped twice and netted to zero. Polling moved into `_poll_run_toggle()`, called once at
  the top of `_physics_process`, and `_is_running()` is now a pure query.
- **A missing area left the screen permanently black.** `ScreenFade` starts opaque and only
  `Director` lifts it, so the early-return in `game_root.gd` stranded the player. It now logs
  an error naming the expected path and requests the fade-in regardless.
- **`player_yaw` was saved and never read.** Written to every save since the first commit,
  read nowhere, so facing was silently lost on load. Restored via `_yaw_override`.
- **A fresh clone did not run at all.** Proved by cloning the repo to a scratch directory:
  `class_name` globals live in `.godot/global_script_class_cache.cfg`, which is generated and
  correctly gitignored, so `events.gd` could not resolve `GameEnums`, the `Events` autoload
  failed to instantiate, and the console filled with parse errors that look like broken code.
  One `--headless --import` fixes it. Now documented in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and
  `docs/CONTEXT.md`.
- **The silent fallback that hid a bug is now loud.** `EnvironmentDriver`'s sibling discovery
  reported at `Log.debug`; it is a `Log.warn` now, so an unwired scene reference cannot hide
  behind a working-looking day/night cycle again. Also added the canonical
  `node_paths=PackedStringArray(...)` header to the `EnvironmentDriver` node in
  `courtyard.tscn`, which is the documented serialization for node-typed exports.
- **Built `tests/test_runner.gd` + `.tscn`:** 55 assertions over `DictRead` coercion, `Flags`
  including no-op-set silence, `Clock` hour/day rollover and midnight-crossing arithmetic,
  `Weather` force and shelter, and a full save round-trip.
- Added `docs/CONTEXT.md`, a one-minute state snapshot for a new session, linked from the top
  of `CLAUDE.md` and the first row of the README table.

**Why:**

Two of the four Veilbound failure modes had already reappeared in miniature, in this project,
at 1/600th scale. `ROADMAP.md` marked "a save participant can register, and the save envelope
round-trips" as a met Phase 0 exit criterion when only the registration had ever been observed,
as a log line — the save path had never once executed. That is precisely the
409-passing-checks pathology. The criterion is now genuinely true, and the roadmap records
that it was wrongly claimed a day earlier rather than quietly correcting itself.

**Connects:**

Rung 4 had to become a **scene** entered positionally, not the `--script` tool the
architecture document specified. Under `--headless --script` the autoload *nodes* are created
but the autoload *identifiers* fail to compile (`Compile Error: Identifier not found: Log`),
so no test touching a system could ever have run that way. The documented command could not
have worked; it is corrected in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `CONTEXT.md`.

**Verified:**

- Type gate clean on all four edited scripts.
- `--headless --import` clean.
- `--headless --quit-after 60` — loads the courtyard, `0 warnings, 0 errors`.
- `--headless res://tests/test_runner.tscn --quit-after 150` — **55 passed, 0 failed**, exit 0.
  A deliberately broken assertion was confirmed to produce exit 1, so the gate genuinely fails.
- `tools/check_budgets.gd` — 24 files, 2,026 code lines, 0 violations, exit 0.

**Unblocks:**

Interaction, items and world objects can now be built against a suite that will catch a
regression in save, time or flags, rather than against a boot log.

**Known gaps:**

Still zero typed `Resource` content classes and zero `tr()` calls, so the "adding the
fiftieth item touches no code" test in `ARCHITECTURE.md` cannot yet be run even once, and the
no-hard-coded-strings rule has a document but no mechanism. No stable-object-ID scheme, which
blocks object persistence and is the next thing to decide. Trigger volumes have a folder, a
collision layer and no system. The audit that found this was itself incomplete — three of five
dimensions landed before the run hit a weekly usage limit; correctness and Godot-API review
were done by hand instead, and the surviving reports are in the scratchpad, not the repo.

---

## 2026-08-23 — Phase 0 foundation, and a lit courtyard with a character in it

**Did:**

Created the project from an empty folder.

- **Structure:** 80 directories in five code layers (`core`, `systems`, `gameplay`,
  `content`, `ui`), plus `scenes`, `data`, `assets`, `localization`, `tests`, `tools`, `docs`.
  Git initialised on `main`. `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` written, including a note that
  `*.uid` and `*.import` files **must** be committed.
- **Engine config** (`project.godot`): Forward+, MSAA 4x, TAA deliberately off, debanding on,
  occlusion culling on, gravity 24, ten named collision layers, editor folder colours, and
  GDScript warnings-as-errors.
- **Ten autoloads:** `Log`, `Events`, `Actions`, `Settings`, `SaveSystem`, `Flags`, `Clock`,
  `Weather`, `Audio`, `Director`.
- **Utilities:** `Layers`, `GameEnums`, `DictRead`.
- **Gameplay:** `HD2DCameraRig`, `CharacterVisual`, `PlayerController`, `EnvironmentDriver`,
  `AreaRoot`, screen fade, game root.
- **Tools:** procedural placeholder art generator, and `DevCapture` for screenshots and
  command-line control of time and weather.
- **Content:** the `courtyard` area and the player scene.
- **Docs:** this log, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SYSTEMS_INVENTORY.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `CONVENTIONS.md`, and decision records.

**Why:**

The previous project died of four things, all recorded in its own debt register: god objects
(`main.gd` at 3,983 lines), code that passed 409 static checks while never once running in a
real engine frame, 200 hard-coded strings, and eleven regions of breadth with no proven
slice. Every structural decision here targets one of those. The two strongest levers are
warnings-as-errors, which makes untyped and unsafe code fail to parse at all, and the
verification ladder, which makes "it runs" a command rather than an opinion.

**Connects:**

`Log` and `Events` sit at the bottom and depend on nothing, so everything may use them.
`Events` is the single declared home for every cross-system signal, which makes it the
connection map — reading that one file shows how the game is wired. `SaveSystem` knows
nothing about game content: systems register a pair of callables, so adding a saveable system
never edits the save code. `Clock` publishes time and refuses to interpret it;
`EnvironmentDriver` consumes it and turns it into light. `Director` owns every area
transition behind one guarded path so two doors cannot fire at once. `GameRoot` spawns the
player once and `Director` repositions them per area, so walking out and back in cannot lose
state.

**Verified:**

- `--headless --import` — clean, no errors.
- `--headless --quit-after 30` — boots, loads the courtyard, spawns the player, exits 0 with
  **0 warnings and 0 errors**.
- Parse and type gate over all 18 scripts — every one clean under warnings-as-errors.
- Deliberately broken script → exit 1 naming the file and line, so the gate genuinely fails.
- Visual capture at 06:50, 12:30, 18:40 and 22:00, plus a forced storm. Dawn shows warm low
  light and long raked shadows; night shows cold ambient with two warm lantern pools and the
  character lit by them. **The character sprite casts a real shadow**, which confirms
  `ALPHA_CUT_DISCARD` is behaving as intended.

**Two real bugs found and fixed by that visual pass**, neither of which any static check
would have caught:

1. The character was invisible. `centered = false` with a negative Y offset pushed the sprite
   1.68 m below the ground. Now centred and lifted by half a cell height, derived from the
   texture rather than hard-coded.
2. Every hour of the day rendered identically. `EnvironmentDriver`'s `sun` and `moon`
   `@export` references were never wired in the area scene, so the driver held `null` and the
   directional light stayed frozen at its default energy forever. Wired explicitly, **and**
   the driver now discovers its own siblings by name and logs a warning when it has to — so
   the same silent failure cannot recur.

The second one is the whole argument for rung 5 of the ladder. A day/night system that
compiles, runs, logs correct times, reports no errors, and lights nothing.

**Unblocks:**

The interaction, item and object systems, which are the next milestone. They have somewhere
to live (`Interactables/` in every area), a way to be found (`Layers.INTERACT_MASK`), a way to
announce themselves (four interaction signals already declared in `Events`), a way to persist
(`Flags` plus the area's `flag_key()` namespace), and a way to be seen (placeholder art plus
capture).

**Known gaps:**

No test runner yet, so rung 4 of the ladder is unused. No audio
assets, so every audio path is written but unexercised. Weather publishes state but nothing
renders rain. Only one area exists, so the transition code has never actually swapped two
areas. Input actions do not appear in the editor's Input Map panel, which is a known accepted
trade-off.
