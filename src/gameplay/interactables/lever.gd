class_name Lever
extends Interactable
## A switch the player throws to change the world. Toggles a persistent boolean and
## announces it; what that boolean *causes* is somebody else's business.
##
## WHY IT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT OPENS
## The tempting design is `@export var door_to_open`. That couples every lever to a specific
## consequence, and the second time a lever needs to do two things, or a different lever needs
## to do the same thing, the coupling has to be undone. Instead the lever owns a flag, and
## anything in the world may watch that flag. One lever can gate five things without knowing
## any of them exist.
##
## OWNS: its on/off state and its persistence.
## MUST NOT: know what its state causes.

const STATE_FIELD: StringName = &"thrown"

## Also mirrored into a world flag under this name, so anything can watch it without holding
## a reference to this node. Leave empty to keep the state purely local to the object.
@export var world_flag: StringName = &""
## Localization keys for the toast shown when thrown either way. Optional.
@export var notify_on_key: String = ""
@export var notify_off_key: String = ""

signal toggled(is_on: bool)

## Used only when the object has no PersistentState child, i.e. a lever whose state is
## deliberately not saved.
