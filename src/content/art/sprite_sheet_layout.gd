## How a character sprite sheet is cut up, as authored data. The art CONTRACT this template
## ships, and the reason a game with a different sheet edits no code.
##
## WHY THIS EXISTS. CharacterVisual used to carry `FACING_COUNT = 8` and `FRAME_COUNT = 4` as
## constants, and the eight-way sector maths as a SEPARATE literal `TAU / 8.0` that had to agree
## with the first by hand. Two places holding one number is a bug waiting for the first game whose
## sheet has four facings. Here the count appears once and the sector width is DERIVED from it, so
## the two cannot disagree.
##
## THE SHEET IS COLUMNS OF FACING BY ROWS OF FRAME, and the rows are grouped into ANIMATIONS:
##
##     facings = 4, frames = 3, animations = 2, idle_row = 0, walk_row = 1
##
##             col 0    col 1    col 2    col 3
##     row 0   idle.0   idle.0   idle.0   idle.0     <- animation 0 (idle), frame 0
##     row 1   idle.1   ...                          <- animation 0, frame 1
##     row 2   idle.2   ...                          <- animation 0, frame 2
##     row 3   walk.0   ...                          <- animation 1 (walk), frame 0
##     row 4   walk.1   ...
##     row 5   walk.2   ...
##
## So `sheet_rows()` is `frames * animations`, and an animation is addressed by its INDEX, not by
## its first row — an author who moves the walk block down does not have to recount.
## `animations = 1` with both rows at 0 is the single-block sheet this project shipped before
## T2.1, which is why every existing sheet keeps working unchanged.
##
## A FACING IS NOT A COLUMN. `GameEnums.Facing` has eight values because that is what the GAME
## reasons about — which way a character is turned. How many of those the ART distinguishes is a
## separate question this resource answers, and `column_for_angle` answers it by quantising the
## angle into `facings` sectors rather than by mapping down from eight.
##
## OWNS: the dimensions of one sheet, and validating them against the texture.
## MUST NOT: hold a texture, touch a node, know what animation a character is playing, or touch
## an autoload — tools/ loads content classes under `--script`, where autoload identifiers do not
## resolve, so a single `Log` call here would break a build gate.

## Cells across: how many directions the art distinguishes. The sector width is derived from
## this and nothing else.
@export_range(1, 32, 1) var facings: int = 8
## Cells down within ONE animation: the length of its cycle.
@export_range(1, 64, 1) var frames: int = 4
## How many animation blocks are stacked down the sheet. 1 is a sheet with a single cycle.
@export_range(1, 32, 1) var animations: int = 1
## One cell in texture pixels. DECLARED rather than divided out of the texture, so a sheet of the
## wrong size is a named problem instead of every character in the game silently misplaced.
@export var cell_size: Vector2i = Vector2i(32, 48)
## Which animation block plays when standing still, and which when moving. Equal values mean the
## sheet has no separate idle, which is legal and was the only possibility before T2.1.
@export_range(0, 31, 1) var idle_row: int = 0
@export_range(0, 31, 1) var walk_row: int = 0
## THE GAITS, and -1 MEANS "REPLAY THE WALK BLOCK". A sheet with no distinct run cycle is the
## normal case and was the ONLY case before T5.2 - `animation_for` took a bool, so run and
## sneak drew the walk block faster and nothing else. Declaring these as -1 rather than 0
## matters: 0 is a real row, so a default of 0 would silently draw the IDLE block for a
## running character on every sheet that had not been updated.
@export_range(-1, 31, 1) var run_row: int = -1
@export_range(-1, 31, 1) var sneak_row: int = -1
@export_range(-1, 31, 1) var climb_row: int = -1




## WHICH ANIMATION BLOCK A MOVE STATE PLAYS. It took a BOOLEAN until T5.2, which is why a sheet
## could only ever have an idle cycle and a walk cycle: run and sneak replayed the walk block at a
## different rate and there was nowhere to put a distinct one. `GameEnums.MoveState` had ten
## values and `Events.player_state_changed` was emitted and listened to by nothing, so the
## information existed and had no way to reach the sprite.
##
## THE FALLBACK CHAIN IS THE POINT, not a convenience. A gait row left at -1 inherits the WALK
## block, so every sheet authored before this existed behaves exactly as it did, and a game adds a
## run cycle by drawing one and naming its row - no code, in this file or anywhere else. States
## with no gait of their own fall to IDLE: there is no jumping and no swimming in this template,
## and BUSY and LOCKED are "something else is driving", which looks like standing there.
##
## Clamped rather than trusted, because a row past the end of the sheet should draw the last block
## instead of an out-of-range cell - and `problems()` reports it so the author hears about it.
