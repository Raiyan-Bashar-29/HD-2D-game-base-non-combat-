## User preferences. Autoload `Settings`.
##
## WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM Flags
## Settings belong to the player's machine, not to the save file. Copying a save to another
## computer should not drag someone else's resolution and volume along with it. Different
## lifetime, different file.
##
## Stored as a plain ConfigFile at user://settings.cfg so a player can read and repair it by
## hand if a bad value ever locks them out of the game.
##
## OWNS: the settings file, the default values, and applying the ones that belong to the
## window and the display server.
## MUST NOT: apply audio, world or gameplay settings itself. It announces a change through
## Events.setting_changed and the owning system reacts. That keeps this file from growing a
## branch for every feature that ever gains an option.

const PATH: String = "user://settings.cfg"

## Every setting the game has, with its default. This is also the validation list: a key
## that is not here is rejected, so a typo cannot silently create a dead setting.
##
## AND EVERY KEY HERE IS READ BY SOMETHING. `settings_screen.gd` generates its rows FROM this
## dictionary, so a key added here is drawn to the player immediately - which makes a key with no
## consumer worse than a dead constant: the player is shown a control that does nothing. Twelve
## of twenty-three were in that state until T5.5. Nine were wired; three were REMOVED, because
## honouring them would have meant inventing a feature rather than connecting one - and ONE OF
## THREE HAVE NOW COME BACK WITH THEIR FEATURE, which is what that decision was for:
##   `gameplay/camera_shake`   - RESTORED at T5.9. It had no shake to scale; `HD2DCameraRig` has
##                               one now, names this key as `SHAKE_SETTING`, and reads it as a
##                               0..1 veto on the amplitude the area author gave that rig.
##   `gameplay/autosave`       - RESTORED at T5.10. There was no autosave and `SaveSystem` had no
##                               notion of the slot a run belongs to, so `true` meant nothing.
##                               `SaveSystem.AUTOSAVE_SLOT` is that notion and `Autosave` is the
##                               policy; this key is the player's veto over it and nothing more.
##   `accessibility/subtitles` - still out. Nothing is voiced, so there is nothing to caption.
## The one left is one line here plus one CSV row to bring back the day its feature exists; the
## screen needs no edit at all, which the shake and the autosave have now both proved literally
## rather than by claim. `tests/unit/settings_consumers_test.gd` is what refuses a key with no
## reader, so do not re-add one before its consumer.

## THE SECOND SETTING THIS FILE APPLIES ITSELF, and for `_apply_display`'s reason rather than by
## analogy with it: nothing else owns `TranslationServer` either. A consumer would have to be a
## system, and "the language" is not one - every screen reads it, none of them owns it.
##
## NOT skipped under headless, which is the one way this differs from the display. A translation
## has no window in it, so the suite can and does assert against `tr()` - and the criterion this
## closes ("switch language at runtime and see every visible string change") would otherwise be
## provable only by eye.
##
## An empty or unknown locale is left alone rather than forced: `TranslationServer` falls back to
## the project's default, and a settings file hand-edited to nonsense should not blank the UI.

## THE THIRD THING THIS FILE APPLIES ITSELF, on `_apply_display`'s reasoning: the render scale is
## a property of the VIEWPORT, and no system owns the viewport either. Announcing it would mean
## inventing a listener whose only job is to set one property on a node it does not own.
##
## Clamped, because `scaling_3d_scale` at 0.0 renders a zero-pixel image and a hand-edited
## settings file must not be able to blank the game.

	var viewport: Viewport = get_viewport()

## AND THE FOURTH, for the reason that decided where `video/bloom` went and then pointed the other
## way. Bloom belongs to `EnvironmentDriver` because the Environment is that node's. But shadows
## are cast by LIGHTS AN AREA AUTHOR PLACED - the courtyard has four - and no node owns the set of
## them. Enumerating lights would mean a driver that walks the scene tree and gets it wrong for
## every light added after it, which is the shape of the god object ADR-0001 refuses.
##
## So it is applied at the ATLAS instead: a shadow map of size zero means every light in the world
## casts nothing, whoever placed it and whenever. A game that adds a hundred lights gets this
## setting for free and writes no code, which is the whole test of a template seam.
##
## THE RESTORE HALF WAS WRONG UNTIL T5.7, and only the OFF half was ever photographed. Turning
## shadows back on wrote a 2048 const, and 4096 is what this project — and the engine — actually
## authors, so a player who toggled the setting once got half the shadow resolution back and
## nothing said so. `ShadowAtlas` remembers the authored sizes before the first zeroing, which is
## the only moment they can still be read.
