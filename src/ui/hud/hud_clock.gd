## The clock readout. The whole HUD, for now, and deliberately the whole of this file.
##
## WHY THIS IS ITS OWN NODE AND NOT A "Hud" THAT OWNS EVERYTHING
## The prompt and the toasts already exist as siblings under `UILayer`, each listening to the
## bus for the one thing it draws. A `Hud` node that adopted them would put three unrelated
## concerns behind one parent whose only job is to forward signals, and the next readout —
## weather, an objective, a day counter — would join it rather than stand on its own. So the
## HUD is a *layer*, not a class: independent readouts, each subscribing to what it shows.
##
## It is PAUSABLE on purpose. Behind an open menu no in-game minute passes, so a clock that
## kept ticking would be lying. Pause table: src/ui/root/ui_root.gd.
##
## OWNS: the rendering of the current time.
## MUST NOT: advance time, decide what an hour means, or read any other system. It draws what
## `Clock` announces.
