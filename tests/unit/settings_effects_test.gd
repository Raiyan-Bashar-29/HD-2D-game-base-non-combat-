## WHAT A SETTING DOES, rather than whether anything reads it.
##
## THE SPLIT FROM `settings_consumers_test.gd` IS BY QUESTION, and it was forced by a budget the
## way T5.6's was. That file asks *is this key reached, and is its consumer wired into the running
## game* - a reachability question, answered against `Settings.DEFAULTS` and `SceneState`. This one
## asks *and does the effect actually happen* - answered by driving the real path and reading the
## number that comes back. The two questions fail differently and are worth failing separately: a
## key can be read by a consumer that does the wrong thing with it, which is exactly the pair of
## defects T5.7 found.
##
## BOTH SUBJECTS HERE ARE T5.5 LEAVING A SETTING HALF-APPLIED, and neither was a mistake at the
## time - both are written down in that row's own DEVLOG as gaps:
##
##   `accessibility/reduce_motion` reached the dialogue typewriter and neither of the other two
##   motions this template draws. A preference honoured in one place out of three is a preference
##   the player will discover is untrue.
##
##   `video/shadows` turned the atlas off correctly and turned it back on at a 2048 const called
##   "the engine's own default". The engine's default is 4096. Only the OFF half had ever been
##   photographed, and off is the half a wrong constant cannot break.
##
## NOTHING HERE IS PHOTOGRAPHED, and that is a finding rather than an omission. A cut and a
## finished dissolve are the same picture; a camera at rest is the same picture however it got
## there; and `--headless` shades nothing anyway (gotcha 2). What separates them is the frames
## BETWEEN, so every assertion below drives the real path one step at a time and reads a value
## that only one of the two behaviours can produce.
##
## OWNS: assertions that reduce-motion reaches every motion the template draws, that the screen
## shake is the player scale on the area author's amplitude, and that the shadow atlas comes back
## at the authored size, and that the autosave lands in a slot no manual save can reach.
## MUST NOT: ask whether a setting has a consumer at all - `settings_consumers_test.gd` owns that,
## and duplicating its scan here would give two answers to one question.

const FADE: GDScript = preload("res://src/ui/hud/screen_fade.gd")
## Long enough that a real tween cannot have finished by the next statement. `run()` is
## synchronous, so a tweened fade has moved NOTHING when control comes back - which is exactly
## what makes an instant one distinguishable from an animated one without a single frame passing.

## An area-authored smoothing, deliberately not the rig's own default, so the restore assertion
## proves the AUTHORED number came back rather than a default that happens to match.

## not a float-comparison argument.

const PHYSICS_DELTA: float = 1.0 / 60.0
## An area-authored shake amplitude, in metres of camera slide at full strength. Deliberately
## not the rig's own default, for `SOFT_LAG`'s reason: a restore assertion has to prove the
## AUTHORED number came back and not a default that happens to match it.
const AUTHORED_SHAKE: float = 0.4
## How long a measured shake decays over. Long enough that one physics step is nowhere near the
## end of it, so "it came back to rest" is a claim about the decay and not about rounding.
const SHAKE_SECONDS: float = 0.6
## What `_apply_shadows` used to restore, kept here as the thing that must NOT come back. It is

## constant something might start using again.

## A size no project setting has, so a `ShadowAtlas` that answered it can only have read this
## viewport.

## the whole point: the policy asks whether a run EXISTS, never which area it is in.

##
## What CAN be measured is the real path, driven from outside: `Events.screen_fade_requested` is
## the only input this node has, and `run()` is synchronous, so a tween created inside the
## handler has not advanced by the time the next line reads `color.a`. A dissolve therefore
## leaves the alpha where it started and a cut leaves it at the target - one assertion, no
## awaits, no test-only accessor, and no reaching at the private tween.

## a real step, and only the SETUP reads the exported number.
##

## request and takes exactly one step, so the phase is identical every time; a random jitter
## would have made "half as far" an unassertable claim, which is the argument for the waveform
## rather than a happy consequence of it.
