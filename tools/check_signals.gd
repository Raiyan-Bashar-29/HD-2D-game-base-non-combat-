## Signal gate: FAILS if a signal declared in the registry has no emitter anywhere.
##
## RUN:  godot_console --headless --script tools/check_signals.gd
## Exit 0 if clean, 1 on any violation. Sits in the ladder next to check_boundary.gd.
##
## THE STRUCTURAL HOLE THIS CLOSES. Four gates already stood — content, budgets, strings, the
## demo boundary — and NOT ONE OF THEM ASKED WHETHER A DECLARED THING HAS A CONSUMER. That is
## why "correct code with no consumer" has now been found seven times, every time through a
## fully green ladder. `item_used` and `debug_command` were both declared, both typed, both
## documented, and neither was ever emitted; this gate would have said so on the day each
## landed. It is the cheapest possible instance of the general rule, because the registry is
## ONE file and every declaration in it is one line.
##
## WHY A STATIC SCAN IS SOUND HERE, and the two preconditions it checks rather than assumes:
## there are zero `[connection]` blocks in any .tscn in the repository, and zero
## `emit_signal("name")` string calls. Either would let a signal be used without the text
## `Events.<name>` ever appearing, and the gate would then be measuring nothing. Both are
## asserted below, so the gate fails the day its own reasoning stops holding — the same shape
## as check_boundary.gd's debug-gate precondition.
##
## THE METHOD TRAP, which a naive grep for `<name>.emit` walks straight into. Several signals
## are dispatched INDIRECTLY, as first-class `Signal` values: the quest tracker passes
## `Events.quest_started` into a helper that calls `fact.emit`, and two screens return an
## `Array[Signal]` and connect to each member generically. A grep for `.emit` finds neither,
## so `quest_started` would read as dead. So a bare `Events.<name>` reference is resolved by
## what its FILE does with a `Signal`-typed identifier: a file that calls `.emit` on one is an
## emitter, a file that calls `.connect` on one is a listener. See _dispatch_role.
##
## MUST NOT: reference the `Events` autoload, or any autoload. The registry is read as TEXT,
## deliberately — a gate that needed the game booted could not run before the game boots.

## What makes a neighbouring character part of an identifier. Same alphabet check_boundary.gd

## THE ESCAPE HATCH, AND WHY IT IS A PHRASE IN THE DOC COMMENT RATHER THAN A LIST HERE.
## A signal with no emitter is not always a defect: `item_used` is a RESERVED NAME the template
## declares for a consuming game to emit from its own item script, which is Tier 2 in
## docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. That is a real decision and it deserves to be recorded — but next to
## the declaration, where the next reader is already looking, not in a list in a tool nobody
## opens. So the exemption is granted by writing this phrase in the signal's own `##` block,
## and a signal that both carries it AND has an emitter fails too, because a stale exemption
## is how a gate rots into decoration.
