class_name RestPoint
extends Interactable
## A bed, a bench or a campfire: somewhere to sit and let the hours go by. The player's only
## way of asking the world to move time forward.
##
## WHY A TIME SKIP IS ONE EVENT AND NOT A FAST-FORWARD
## The naive implementation runs the clock quickly until it reaches morning, which means every
## listener in the game - lighting, schedules, weather, ambience - is woken 480 times for an
## eight-hour sleep, and any of them that does real work per minute now does it 480 times in
## one frame. Clock.skip_to_hour exists so that a skip is a single set_time, and this object
## is its only gameplay caller.
##
## OWNS: which hour it rests until, and whether it may be used now.
## MUST NOT: change the lighting, fade the screen, save the game, or know why the hour it
## jumps to matters. It moves the clock. Everything downstream of the clock is somebody else's.

## The hour rested until. If it has already passed today, the rest rolls over to tomorrow -
## a bench you sit on at dawn to reach dusk works with the same field as a bed.
@export_range(0, 23, 1) var target_hour: int = 6
## Refuse before dusk, for a bed that is only for sleeping the night through. Off by default,
## so a bench is usable at any hour.
@export var night_only: bool = false
## Optional toast shown afterwards. A localization key, never raw text.
@export var rested_key: String = ""

## Local listeners. `minutes` is how much time was actually skipped.
