## Generates placeholder art procedurally, so the whole game can be built and looked at
## before a single real asset exists.
##
## WHY THIS IS A REAL TOOL AND NOT A HACK
## Art is deliberately deferred on this project. Without stand-ins, every visual system
## (billboarding, sprite lighting, facing, the camera rig, depth of field) would have to be
## written blind and verified later, which is how a rendering bug survives to month three.
## These files are ugly on purpose so nobody mistakes them for finished work.
##
## AND A PLACEHOLDER THAT CANNOT SHOW A SYSTEM WORKING IS NOT DOING ITS JOB, which is what T5.8
## found. Both sheets drew ONE POSE PER GAIT and repeated it across every facing, so the facing
## system - quantised correctly, asserted at both ends, driven through the real input path - was
## invisible on screen from Phase 1 until an owner played the game and said that sideways
## movement "just slides to the side". Improving this tool is not a retraction of "art is
## deferred": the deferred thing is ART, and this is the instrument the systems are read with.
##
## RUN:  godot_console --headless --script tools/gen_placeholders.gd
## OUT:  assets/placeholder/*.png  (committed, small, regenerable at any time)
##
## Note: this script cannot use the autoloads. A --script run does not create them, so it
## uses print() directly rather than Log. That is the one place in the project where that
## is allowed.

# THE SECOND SHEET, and it exists to be a DIFFERENT SHAPE rather than a second character.
# T2.1's headline claim is that a game swaps in a sheet with another cell and frame count and
# edits no code, so the proof needs a sheet that disagrees with the first one on every number:
# 4 facings not 8, a 24x40 cell not 32x48, and 3 frames in each of FIVE animation blocks rather
# than 4 frames in three. Its layout is assets/placeholder/character_alt_layout.tres.
#
# IT HAD TWO BLOCKS UNTIL T5.6, and that gap is the reason that row existed. T5.2 gave the
# DEFAULT sheet three blocks and left this one at idle and walk, so a sheet with a different
# cell size AND a full gait set existed nowhere in the repository - while the phase's whole
# claim is that a future game inherits working characters and changes only assets. A swap that
# proves only the GRID moves proves half of it. This sheet now names all five gaits
# SpriteSheetLayout can address: idle, walk, run, sneak, climb.
#
# AND ITS FOUR COLUMNS WERE THE SAME FIGURE UNTIL T5.8, exactly as the default sheet's eight
# were - three of them differed only by the column tally. Its three poses come from the same
# table: column 0 is the front, columns 1 and 3 are a profile and its mirror, column 2 the back.
#
# EVERY CELL IS SELF-LABELLING, which is the point. A character drawn from the wrong cell still
# looks like a character (gotcha 2, in the one form headless cannot answer), so each cell carries
# a column tally down its left edge, a frame tally along its foot and - since the gait set - a
# BLOCK tally down its right edge. A windowed capture can then be READ rather than judged: three
# left pips, two foot pips and four right pips is column 2, frame 1, block 3, and no amount of
# plausible-looking pixel art can fake that. Without the third tally the block would be the one
# thing in a capture that had to be inferred from a tint, which is exactly the judgement
