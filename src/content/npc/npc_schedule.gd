class_name NpcSchedule
extends ContentEntry
## Where one NPC is at every hour of the day, as authored data.
##
## THE ID IS THE FILE NAME, exactly as for items and conversations: `data/schedules/keeper.tres`
## must declare `id = &"schedule/keeper"`. Third content type, third time the same rule, and it
## is the same rule for the same reason - a copy-paste slip becomes a named startup failure
## rather than an NPC that silently never goes anywhere.
##
## ENTRIES ARE SORTED ON LOOKUP, NOT ON LOAD. Authored order is whatever the writer found
## convenient; `entry_for_hour` does not care, because it picks the entry with the greatest
## `from_hour` not exceeding the hour asked for, and falls back to the LAST entry of the day
## when the hour is earlier than every block. That fallback is what makes a night shift work:
## an NPC whose day starts at 06:00 is, at 02:00, still doing whatever it was doing at 22:00.
##
## AND A BLOCK IS ADDRESSED BY AN HOUR *AND* A DAY OF THE CYCLE, WHICH IS T5.32. Before it, the
## hour was the whole address, so this class could describe exactly one day and every NPC in a
## game repeated it forever. `on_day_of_cycle` of `-1` means every day and is the default, so an
## every-day schedule is written exactly as it always was; a day-specific entry BEATS an every-day
## entry at the same hour, which is the whole authoring gesture — a market day is one entry added
## beside the ordinary block, not a second schedule.
##
## THE DAY ARGUMENT DEFAULTS TO `-1` FOR THE SAME REASON THE FIELD DOES, and the default is the
## careful half. `-1` asked of the lookup means "no particular day", and only every-day entries
## are considered — so a caller written before this argument existed gets the answer it always
## got, and a game that never mentions a cycle never sees one. What it does NOT mean is "any day":
## that reading would have made a day-specific block leak into every day, which is the defect this
## whole change exists to make expressible in the first place.
##
## OWNS: the immutable schedule of one NPC, and validating its own shape.
## MUST NOT: know which NPC uses it, move anything, or touch an autoload — which is why nothing
## here validates a day against the real cycle length; `schedule_entry.gd` records that cost.

## `id` is inherited from `ContentEntry`; for this catalogue it is `schedule/` plus this file name.
## In any order. Each runs until the next begins; the last wraps around midnight.
@export var entries: Array[ScheduleEntry] = []


## Which block covers this hour on this day of the cycle. Null only when there are no entries
## that apply at all. `on_day` of `-1` considers only every-day entries; see the header.
