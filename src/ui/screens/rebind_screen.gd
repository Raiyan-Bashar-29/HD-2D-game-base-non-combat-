class_name RebindScreen
extends MenuScreen
## Every rebindable action, its key and its pad button, and one press to change either.
##
## THE LIST IS `Actions.REBINDABLE`, IN ITS ORDER. That constant was written in WP-0 with the
## comment "in the order a rebinding screen should list them" and then had no reader for eleven
## packages. This is the reader; the order still lives with the actions, not here.
##
## PRESS A ROW, THEN PRESS THE THING YOU WANT. The next key or pad button becomes the binding.
## Escape aborts without changing anything, which is why capture happens in `_input`: it runs
## before `UiRoot._unhandled_input`, so the escape that cancels listening cannot also close the
## screen behind it.
##
## A KEY AND A PAD BUTTON ARE SEPARATE HALVES. Rebinding one never touches the other, and
## neither touches the analogue stick - see `KeyBindings`. So a player who reassigns the whole
## keyboard still has a working controller, which is the exit criterion this package is judged
## on.
##
## OWNS: the rows, and which action is currently listening.
## MUST NOT: write the input map or the override file itself. `KeyBindings` owns both, and
## `Actions` owns what the defaults are.
