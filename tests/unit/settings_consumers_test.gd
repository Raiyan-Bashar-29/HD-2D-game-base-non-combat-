## THE HEADLINE ASSERTION IS `_every_setting_has_a_consumer()`, and it is this package's answer
## to a question the ladder's six checkers cannot ask.
##
## WHY THIS IS AN ASSERTION AND NOT A SEVENTH CHECKER. T5.4 added three gates that each ask
## "does a declared thing have a consumer?", and none of them can see a SETTING: a setting is a
## string key in a Dictionary read through `get_bool` / `get_float`, not a `class_name`, not a
## `signal`, not a CSV row. So the question had to be asked somewhere new. It is asked here
## rather than in `tools/` because of what the two places can reach. A `check_*` tool reads text
## off disk and would have to reconstruct the key list by parsing `settings.gd`; a test has
## `Settings.DEFAULTS` as the engine actually loaded it. Where the subject of a rule is available
## at RUNTIME, the assertion is the truer place, and T5.4's three went to tools for the mirror
## reason - which layer a path is in, and what a `.tscn` contains, no running game can see.
## CI runs the suite as its own step, so the coverage is identical either way.
##
## THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO BE A CONSUMER, and writing the assertion is what found the third:
##
##   1. NAME THE KEY. Every consumer wired by T5.5 does, as a `const` on itself - which is
##      `PlayerController.PACE`'s convention applied to settings, so a setting nobody reads has
##      nowhere to be written down.
##   2. NAME THE SECTION. `audio_director.gd` handles `section == "audio"` wholesale and then
##      builds each key as `"audio/%s" % bus_name.to_lower()`. The five volume keys therefore
##      appear NOWHERE as literals and no scan can ever find them - the same computed-key
##      situation as the settings screen's own row labels and the prompt's verb keys, and
##      handled the way this project already handles those: mechanically, not by text.
##   3. BE APPLIED BY `settings.gd` ITSELF. Five keys are - the window mode, vsync, the fps cap,
##      the render scale and the shadow atlas - and that file's header gives the reason: nothing
##      else owns the window, the viewport or the shadow atlas, so a "consumer" elsewhere would
##      be a listener invented to set one property on a node it does not own. For that file
##      alone ONE mention is not enough, because the declaration in DEFAULTS is a mention. Two
##      are required, so the second has to be an application.
##
## AND `settings_screen.gd` IS NEVER A CONSUMER. It names nine keys in its ranges and choices,
## and it is generated FROM `DEFAULTS` - it is the thing that made twelve dead settings visible
## to the player in the first place. Counting it would make this assertion pass on the exact
## state it exists to forbid. Whole-line comments do not count either, in any file: a scan that
## a `##` block can satisfy is a scan a stale comment can keep green.
##
## OWNS: assertions that a setting reaches something, and that the nine wired by T5.5 do.
## MUST NOT: assert how a setting is PRESENTED. `options_test.gd` owns the screen.
