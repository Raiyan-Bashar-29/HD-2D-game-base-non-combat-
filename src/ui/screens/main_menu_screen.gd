class_name MainMenuScreen
extends MenuScreen
## The first thing the game shows. New game, continue, load, settings, controls, quit.
##
## THE BOOT PATH CHANGED FOR THIS SCREEN. GameRoot used to request `courtyard` in its _ready;
## it now emits `main_menu_requested` and this screen chooses. The comment above the old
## constant said "when the main menu exists, it will choose instead", and this is that.
##
## closes_on_cancel IS FALSE, and that is not an oversight. There is nothing behind the main
## menu to go back to - dismissing it would leave a paused, cameraless, empty world with no way
## to reach any screen again. It is the one screen in the game with no exit but its own rows.
##
## CONTINUE AND LOAD ARE OMITTED WHEN NO SAVE EXISTS, not shown disabled. Same reasoning the
## dialogue system uses for a failing choice, and the opposite of the locked gate: a gate you
## cannot open teaches you there is somewhere to come back to, while a Continue you cannot press
## teaches you only that saves are a thing. A first-run menu is New Game, Settings and Quit.
##
## OWNS: which rows the main menu offers and what each one asks for.
## MUST NOT: load an area itself, clear a flag itself, or pause anything. `Director` owns
## starting a game, `SaveSystem` owns restoring one, and `UiRoot` owns the pause.
