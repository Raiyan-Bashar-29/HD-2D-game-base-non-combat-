## Save and load orchestration. Autoload `SaveSystem`.
##
## WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY
## The obvious design is one big save function that reaches into every system and reads its
## variables. That function becomes the god object: it has to know every system, so every new
## feature edits it, and it is the first file to hit a thousand lines. Instead this file knows
## NOTHING about game content. Systems register a pair of callables and own their own format.
##
## A system registers itself, usually in its _ready():
##     SaveSystem.register(&"clock", _collect_save, _apply_save)
##     func _collect_save() -> Dictionary: return {"day": day, "minute": minute}
##     func _apply_save(data: Dictionary, _from: int) -> void: day = DictRead.get_int(data, "day", 1)
##
## OWNS: slot files on disk, the file format, the schema version, atomic writes, migration, and
## which slot NUMBERS exist — including the autosave's, because a number's legality and its path
## are facts about the store.
## MUST NOT: know what any section contains, or decide WHEN a save happens. Adding a saveable
## system never edits this file, and neither does adding an occasion to save on: the autosave
## POLICY lives in `Autosave`, which calls `save_to_slot` like every other caller does.

## Where slot files live when nobody has said otherwise. Separate from `save_dir` below so that
## restoring the default is naming this rather than repeating the literal at every call site.
const DEFAULT_SAVE_DIR: String = "user://saves"
## How many slots the PLAYER may write. Every manual list iterates this, so the autosave slot
## below is outside all of them by construction rather than by a filter somebody has to
## remember to write in each screen.
const MAX_SLOTS: int = 6
## The autosave's slot, ONE PAST the manual six, and one past rather than one OF them so that
## slots 0..5 keep the numbers a player already knows and no save written before this existed
## changes meaning. An autosave that can overwrite a save the player made on purpose is the one
## thing an autosave must never be. This file owns only the fact that the number is legal and
## where it lands on disk; `Autosave` owns when it is written. See src/systems/autosave/.
const AUTOSAVE_SLOT: int = MAX_SLOTS
## Named rather than numbered: `slot_07.json` sitting beside six `slot_NN.json` files would read
## as a seventh manual slot to anyone who opened the folder, which is exactly what it is not.
const AUTOSAVE_FILE: String = "autosave.json"
## Bump when the envelope changes shape. Section contents are each system's own business.
const SCHEMA_VERSION: int = 1

## The directory `slot_path` builds on, and the ONE thing about the store that is not fixed.
##
## WHY THIS IS A `var` AND NOT THE `const` IT WAS. The suite has to write real files to assert
## what the loader does with them, and with a const it wrote them into the developer's REAL save
## directory — the last content root a test run could still reach, every other one being
## repointed by `tests/framework/fixtures.gd`. It cleaned up after itself, which is not the same
## as never having been there: a crashed run left slots behind, and a slot number the suite
## happens to use is a slot number a player may have filled.
##
## PUBLIC RATHER THAN TEST-ONLY, because the same seam is one a GAME may legitimately want — a
## portable build writing beside its executable rather than into `user://` — and a backdoor that
## exists for the suite and for nothing else is what `fixtures.gd`'s own header refuses to add.
## Assigning creates the directory, so no caller has to remember to.
