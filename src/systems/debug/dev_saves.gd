class_name DevSaves
extends Node
## Where a DEBUG LAUNCH keeps its saves: never where the developer keeps theirs.
##
## THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, found by T6.9 while proving the suite no longer ate real saves. The
## ladder's last rung is a windowed capture with `--new-game`, and `--new-game` starts a REAL run.
## T5.10's autosave policy then does exactly what it does for a player: it writes
## `SaveSystem.AUTOSAVE_SLOT` a frame after the area arrives, and again on quit. So every capture,
## in every worktree on the machine, since all of them share one `user://`, wrote over the
## developer's own autosave, and the photograph showed an `Autosaved.` toast as it did so. The
## probes were worse: `--save-state`/`--load-state` and `--cross-area-save` DELETE the slot they
## used, and the slot a probe picks is a slot a developer may have filled by playing.
##
## REDIRECT, NOT SUPPRESS, and that was the decision. Turning autosave off for a capture would fix
## one writer of three and photograph a game that behaves differently from the one a player gets:
## the toast would vanish from the picture, and the `--autosave-write`/`--autosave-continue` pair
## in `dev_scenario_shots.gd`, which exists to prove the autosave works, would prove nothing. Every
## writer goes through `SaveSystem.save_dir`, which T5.22 made a public seam for exactly this kind
## of caller, so ONE assignment here covers the autosave, every probe and every console `save`,
## and the game underneath runs unchanged.
##
## ANY USER ARGUMENT IS A DEBUG LAUNCH. Not only `--shot`: `--save-state` shoots nothing and
## deletes a slot. A plain run from the editor passes none and keeps the real store, so playing
## the game and saving still means what it says. `--real-saves` is the way back, on purpose, for a
## developer who wants a staged launch to write the store they play from.
##
## NEVER EMPTIED HERE, which is the difference from `SaveFixture.ROOT`. The probes come in pairs
## across two PROCESSES (dev_probes.gd says why), and the second must find what the first wrote.
## It is a separate directory from the suite's for the same reason: `SaveFixture.activate()`
## empties that one, so a suite running in another session would eat a capture pair's autosave.
## Deleting `user://dev_saves` by hand is always safe.
##
## FIRST OF THE DEBUG NODES in `game_root.tscn`, before `Autosave`. Nothing writes during `_ready`
## today, and the main menu reads the slots only when `GameRoot._ready` asks for it, after every
## child; first in the tree keeps that true when somebody adds a node that does.
##
## OWNS: which directory a debug launch's saves go to.
## MUST NOT: write, read or delete a save file itself, change when an autosave happens, or be
## depended upon by gameplay. Deleting this file must not break the game.

## The scratch store. Under `user://` for `SaveFixture.ROOT`'s reason: outside the repository.
const SCRATCH_DIR: String = "user://dev_saves"
