## The art contract seams (T2.1): the sprite sheet layout, and the project UI theme.
##
## WHAT THIS CASE CANNOT DO, SAID FIRST SO NOBODY MISREADS A GREEN RUN
## It cannot say what the sprite LOOKS like. A character drawn from the wrong cell still looks
## like a character, which is gotcha 2 in the one form headless cannot answer — `--headless`
## shades nothing. So the swap itself is proved by a WINDOWED CAPTURE that was looked at, with
## the pip tallies on the drawn cell quoted in docs/DEVLOG.md, and this file deliberately claims
## no more than it can see.
##
## WHAT IT CAN DO, AND ALL FOUR ARE LOAD-BEARING
## 1. The sector maths, the frame indexing and the layout's own validation are PURE FUNCTIONS of
##    the facing count. They are exactly what belongs in an assertion, and the compatibility
##    assertion — that an 8x4 layout produces the same index the old `_frame * 8 + facing` did —
##    is the one that says this refactor moved the numbers without moving the picture.
## 2. The two committed layouts agree with the two committed sheets, so a regenerated
##    placeholder whose size moved fails here rather than in a capture nobody takes.
## 3. The theme resolves THROUGH THE PROJECT SETTING on a live Control, not merely as a file
##    that parses. An unwired theme is the same failure shape as an unwired @export.
## 4. No screen file holds a font size or a colour of its own any more. This is the regression
##    gate: the look creeping back into the screens one reasonable line at a time is precisely
##    how it came to live in five files in the first place.
##
## OWNS: assertions about the layout resource and the theme contract.
## MUST NOT: assert what a character or a screen looks like, or name demo content.
