## What a particular player has changed about the input map, and the file it lives in.
##
## WHY THIS IS NOT IN actions.gd
## `Actions` owns the action NAMES and their DEFAULT bindings - a declarative list, readable in
## a diff, which is the whole point of ADR-0003. What one player has since reassigned is a
## different concern with a different lifetime: it belongs to their machine, like `Settings`
## does, not to the project. Folding it in would also have taken actions.gd from 83 code lines
## to 148 of its 150, which is the shape of a file about to be given an exemption.
##
## STORED AS CODES, NOT AS EVENTS. A ConfigFile can hold an InputEventKey object, but then the
## file is a serialised engine class and every property that class has is part of the format.
## One integer per binding is readable, hand-repairable, and cannot break when the engine adds
## a field.
##
## AN ANALOGUE STICK IS NEVER ERASED. Rebinding a key replaces the KEYS of that action and
## rebinding a pad button replaces its PAD BUTTONS. `InputEventJoypadMotion` is neither, so
## `move_up` keeps its left-stick axis however often W is reassigned - which is what stops a
## keyboard rebind from quietly making the game unplayable on a controller.
##
## OWNS: user://input.cfg, and the events it installs into the InputMap.
## MUST NOT: name an action, decide a default, or read input. It mentions `Actions` in exactly
## one expression - `rebind`'s gate - and `Actions` does not mention this class, so the two files
## cannot become a cycle. See that method's note for why the list is read rather than copied.

const PATH: String = "user://input.cfg"
const KEY_FIELD: String = "key"
const PAD_FIELD: String = "pad"


## Bind `action` to `event` and remember it. Returns false for an action that is not REBINDABLE,
## or an event that is neither a key nor a pad button - a mouse wheel cannot be a movement key,
## and saying so is better than storing a binding that never fires.
##
## THE GATE IS `Actions.REBINDABLE`, NOT `InputMap.has_action`, AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS A BUG.
## Until T5.5 this asked only whether the action EXISTED, so `debug_console` or `cam_zoom_in`
## could be overridden and written to input.cfg - and then `reset_bindings()` re-declares only
## the four rebindable groups, so nothing put the erased default back and `forget_all()` was the
## only way out of a file the player could not see. Refusing the write is the fix: an override
## that cannot be reset must not be storable in the first place.
##
## AND THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THE MUST NOT LINE BELOW IS SPENT. It says this file never mentions
## `Actions`; it now does, in exactly one expression, because the alternative is a second copy of
## the rebindable list here and two lists that drift is the defect this project keeps finding.
## `Actions` is an autoload and does not reference this class, so there is still no cycle.
