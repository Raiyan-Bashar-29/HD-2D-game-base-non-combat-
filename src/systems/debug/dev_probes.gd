extends Node
## Scenario probes: the verification that no assertion can perform. Lives in the game root,
## beside `dev_capture.gd`.
##
## WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST AT ALL
## `TestCase.run()` is SYNCHRONOUS — the runner calls it and does not await it — so no assertion
## in this project can wait on a physics frame. That rules out testing, by assertion, every
## behaviour that needs frames to happen: a threaded area load, a navmesh path, a typewriter
## reveal, a key press. Those are not untestable, they are testable by a different means, and
## this is the means. Each probe drives the REAL game through the REAL bus and prints what
## actually happened, so a claim in `DEVLOG.md` is a quotation rather than an assurance.
##
## THREE DEBUG FILES, AND THE BUDGET CHECKER FOUND EVERY SEAM. `dev_capture.gd` answers "what
## does the game LOOK like under condition X" and owns the shutter; this file answers "does
## sequence Y actually work" and owns the measurements; `dev_stage.gd` answers "put the player
## THERE, holding THAT" and owns the posing. All three were one file until the checker refused
## it at 310 and then at 320 of the 250 allowed code lines, and both times the seam it exposed
## was already there in the reasoning.
##
## EVERYTHING AFTER THE BARE `--` IS PASSED TO THE GAME:
##
##   --round-trips=<n>    travel courtyard -> lantern_hall -> courtyard n times, reporting node
##                        count and static memory. This is how the leak criterion is measured,
##                        and each trip also fires a second request in the same frame, so the
##                        re-entrancy guard is exercised twice per trip.
##   --cross-area-save    empty a chest in the hall, take an item in the courtyard, save,
##                        reload, and report whether BOTH survived. Proves world state on the
##                        far side of an area that is no longer loaded.
##   --npc-day            walk the clock through a whole day an hour at a time and report where
##                        each NPC actually ends up. This is how the schedule criterion is
##                        measured: no assertion can drive a navmesh.
##   --npc-storm=<n>      spawn n extra NPCs and report frame time with and without them.
##
## A TEMPORARY PROBE IS THE APPROVED WAY TO TEST AN INPUT PATH. Add one here, run it windowed,
## read the log, quote it in `DEVLOG.md`, then REMOVE it. Two facts that have each cost an hour:
## a synthetic `InputEventAction` must be fed through `Input.parse_input_event`, and a `Button`
## acts on RELEASE by default, so a press alone never fires one.
##
## OWNS: scripted scenarios and the measurements they print.
## MUST NOT: be depended upon by gameplay, or reimplement anything it verifies. A debug path
## that reimplements the thing it is checking checks nothing — every probe here goes through
## the same signals and methods the game uses. Deleting this file must not break the game.
