class_name QuestTracker
extends Node
## Turns flag changes into quest progress. The only thing in the game that reads quest data.
##
## IT KNOWS WHAT A STEP MEANS AND NOTHING ELSE. A step is a `GameEnums.FlagTest` against
## `Flags`, evaluated by `FlagQuery` — the same function a dialogue condition goes through — so
## this file has no idea what any objective IS. It watches one signal, `Events.flag_changed`,
## re-derives every quest, and announces the differences on `Events.quest_*`. Nothing in the
## world has to know the quest system exists: a conversation writes a met/ flag, a lever writes
## an unlocked flag, and a quest that tests either progresses. That is the trigger volume's
## rule — a trigger never names its consequence — applied to narrative state.
##
## DERIVED, EXCEPT FOR TWO LATCHES, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE DESIGN
## flags.gd's header says: if it can be derived, derive it. Almost all of this is derived.
## Two things cannot be:
##   - THAT A QUEST STARTED. Its start condition is a flag, and a game that resets that flag
##     must not un-give a quest the player has been carrying for three hours.
##   - THAT A QUEST COMPLETED. A step may test AT_LEAST 3 on a counter; if something later
##     decrements it, a finished quest would reopen. Completion is a fact about history, not
##     about the world right now.
## So exactly those two are latched, and they are exactly what the save section holds. The
## CURRENT STEP is not latched: it is a live question about the world, so a game that reopens
## the flag behind objective two sees objective two come back. That is a deliberate line, not an
## oversight — the alternative is a per-step latch, which doubles the saved state to remove a
## behaviour nobody has asked for.
##
## A COMPLETED QUEST GRANTS NOTHING. `Events.quest_completed` is emitted and that is all. A
## reward_item field would need `Inventory` and a player, both in the `gameplay` layer, and
## `src/` points downward only — see quest.gd's header.
##
## A NODE, NOT AN AUTOLOAD. Adding an autoload requires an ADR and this one would buy nothing:
## it has no init-order requirement and no interface the boot scene cannot give it. It lives
## under `GameRoot` beside `CatalogueReport`, so it outlives every area and every screen, and it
## is found the way `UiRoot` is found — by group, so a test or a tool can run without one.
##
## OWNS: which quests are active and complete, the current objective of each, and its own save
## section.
## MUST NOT: write a flag, grant anything, draw anything, or know what an objective means.

## The group this node joins, so a screen can find it without a hard path. Same mechanism as
## `UiRoot.GROUP`, for the same reason: the boot scene owns the tree shape, not its consumers.

## Re-entrancy guard, on the same reasoning as Director's. Nothing here writes a flag, but a

## case — and that would land back in `evaluate()` half way through this one.

## HOW FAR ALONG A COUNTED STEP IS: (have, need), and `need == 0` for a step that is not a count.
## Asked live, exactly as `current_step` is.
##
## A PASS-THROUGH, AND THE ONE LINE IN IT IS THE POINT. `JournalScreen` must draw "2 / 3" and its
## MUST NOT line forbids it from reading a flag; `FlagQuery` can answer but is not something a
## screen should be reaching into either. So the screen asks the tracker, the tracker asks the
## closed set, and the seam the journal was built against does not widen. This file still has no
## idea that an item, an inventory or a count of anything exists - a counted step is a flag whose
## value happens to be a number, which is why the whole feature needed no field on `QuestStep`.
