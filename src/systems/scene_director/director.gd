## Area loading and transitions. Autoload `Director`.
##
## WHY IT EXISTS
## Changing area is the single most failure-prone operation in an exploration game: it has to
## unload a live scene, load another off the main thread, place the player on the right spot,
## restore world state, and hide all of it behind a fade. Done ad hoc from a door script it
## goes wrong in a dozen ways, the worst being two doors firing at once and leaving two areas
## in the tree. One owner, one guarded path.
##
## OWNS: which area is loaded, the transition sequence, the world root, and the reference to
## the current player.
## MUST NOT: know what is inside an area, or contain per-area special cases. If an area needs
## something special on entry, that belongs in the area's own script.
##
## HOW TO TRAVEL, from anywhere:
##     Events.area_change_requested.emit(&"orchard", &"south_gate")
## Nothing calls change_area() directly except this file, so every transition is logged in
## one place and the guard cannot be bypassed.

## WHERE A NEW GAME BEGINS IS NOT THIS FILE'S BUSINESS. It lived in `game_root.gd` as
## `const FIRST_AREA := &"courtyard"` until WP-12 and then here until T1.2, and both times it
## was engine code naming demo content. It is now a project setting, read through `GameConfig`.
## The menu names an intention, this file knows what areas are, and project.godot knows which
## game this is.

## WAIT FOR A LOADER THREAD BEFORE THE PROCESS TEARS DOWN.
##
## Quitting while a threaded load is in flight kills the loader thread inside the text parser,
## and the parser then prints `Parse Error` for files that parse perfectly — plus leaked RIDs
## and leaked ObjectDB instances — AFTER the run has already reported `0 warnings, 0 errors`.
## That is gotcha 22 with the polarity REVERSED: not an error the boot rung cannot see, but a
## FALSE error poisoning the `Parse Error` grep over `--headless --import` that rung 2 uses as
## the project's one real compile check. A gate that reports failures which are not there is
## worth as little as one that misses failures which are, and this one lied about the most
## load-bearing check on the ladder — which is why CI's rung 3 had to read only the last line
## of its log instead of the whole thing.
##
## THERE IS NO CANCEL, and that is checked rather than assumed: `--doctool` gives ResourceLoader
## load_threaded_request, load_threaded_get_status and load_threaded_get, and nothing that
## abandons a request. So the only clean end is to WAIT. load_threaded_get() BLOCKS until the
## loader thread finishes — undocumented in the dump, so measured: 118-197ms for the demo's
## larger area, paid once, on the way out.
##
## EXIT_TREE and not a quit handler, measured the same way: on `--headless --quit-after` with a
## load in flight this node receives NOTIFICATION_EXIT_TREE *before* the session's own closing
## log line, NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE after it, and NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST never — headless
## has no window whose closing could be requested.
