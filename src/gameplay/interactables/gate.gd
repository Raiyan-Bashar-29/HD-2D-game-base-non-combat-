class_name Gate
extends Interactable
## A door or gate that can be locked. Proves the refusal path: the player presses the button,
## is told *why* nothing happened, and the same button works once the condition is met.
##
## WHY REFUSAL IS A FIRST-CLASS RESULT
## The cheap implementation is to hide the prompt when the gate is locked. That is worse than
## it sounds: the player cannot tell a locked door from scenery, so they never learn there is
## something to come back for. Offering the interaction and refusing it with a reason is what
## turns a wall into a goal.
##
## OWNS: whether it is open, and its persistence.
## MUST NOT: know how the condition became true, or what is on the other side. It must not
## reach for the player or a global inventory either - it asks whoever is interacting.

const OPEN_FIELD: StringName = &"open"

## Must be true before this gate will open. Empty means it is never locked.
@export var requires_flag: StringName = &""
## Item the interactor must be carrying. Empty means no item is needed. Checked AFTER
## requires_flag, so a gate the plot has sealed says LOCKED rather than sending the player
## hunting for a key that would not help yet.
@export var requires_item: StringName = &""
## The geometry that physically blocks the way. Disabled and hidden when the gate opens.
@export var blocker: StaticBody3D = null
## Shown when the player is refused, and when it opens.
@export var locked_key: String = "refusal.locked"
@export var opened_key: String = ""
## Once open, stay open. A gate that re-locks itself behind the player is a different object.
