class_name ScreenKeys
extends Node
## The one place a thing becomes a screen: an input action, or a request on the bus.
##
## WHY THIS IS A NODE OF ITS OWN
## `UiRoot` must not know what a screen contains, and the player must not know a screen
## exists. Something still has to say "I opens the inventory", and if that binding lives in
## either of them, then the journal key, the map key and the pause key each end up in a
## different file — which is where a boolean per screen came from last time. One node holds
## the whole table, and WP-08's journal and WP-11's map join it here.
##
## PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS, so the key that opened a screen can also close it while the world is
## paused. It never asks "is a screen open" with a flag of its own: `UiRoot.top()` and
## `is_gameplay_input_allowed()` are the only truth, and this node reads them.
##
## OWNS: the action-to-screen and request-to-screen bindings, the one factory that turns a menu
## id into a screen, and unwinding the stack when the world travels.
## MUST NOT: hold a reference to any screen, pause anything, or decide what a screen shows.

## The debug console, on the same toggle shape as the other four and with ONE extra condition.

## THIS IS THE GATE, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE. `src/systems/debug/`'s boundary exemption is granted
## on the precondition that the harness is unreachable in a shipped build, and the console is a
## UI over exactly that harness — a player who found F1 could hand themselves any item in the
## game. So the binding refuses in a release build, `menu_for` refuses too, and
## `src/ui/hud/perf_overlay.gd` carries the same guard in its own `_ready`. All three are
## asserted by `tests/unit/dev_tools_test.gd`, because a guard nobody checks is a guard that gets
## deleted in a refactor.
