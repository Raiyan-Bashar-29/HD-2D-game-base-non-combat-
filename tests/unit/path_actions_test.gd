## Path actions: refused before they run, or committed and then succeeding or failing.
##
## THE HEADLINE ASSERTION IS _barter_fails_then_succeeds(). One action, one player, three
## attempts: refused while a stranger, committed and FAILED at neutral standing, then committed
## and succeeded once standing has been earned. That is the WP-07 criterion walked in one go —
## an action that can fail and change standing — rather than inferred from four separate cases.
##
## THE DISTINCTION UNDER TEST is refusal versus failure. A refusal happens before anything and
## costs nothing; a failure happens after committing and costs standing. An action that could
## only refuse would be a lock with extra steps, and one that could only fail would give the
## player no way to read the situation first. Both halves are asserted, including that a refusal
## really does leave standing untouched.
##
## OWNS: assertions about PathAction data, PathActionPoint outcomes, and the Standing namespace.
## MUST NOT: assert what a prompt looks like, or how the sensor ranks overlapping targets.
