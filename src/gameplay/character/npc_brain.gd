class_name NpcBrain
extends CharacterBody3D
## One non-player character: where it should be, how it gets there, and what it does on arrival.
##
## THE SCHEDULE DECIDES WHERE, THE NAVMESH DECIDES HOW, AND THIS FILE DECIDES NEITHER. It reads
## an `NpcSchedule` for a waypoint name, resolves that name against the area's `Waypoints/` node,
## and hands the position to a `NavigationAgent3D`. Nothing here knows what a market is, and
## nothing here contains a route. That is what makes the fiftieth NPC a `.tscn` override and a
## `.tres` file rather than code.
##
## IT LISTENS TO `hour_passed`, NOT TO `minute_passed`. A schedule changes at most twenty-four
## times a day, so re-deciding sixty times an hour would be sixty times the work for the same
## answer. It also re-decides once on spawn, because an NPC loaded at 14:00 must not stand at
## its midnight post until 15:00.
##
## ARRIVAL IS THE AGENT'S ANSWER, NOT A DISTANCE CHECK. `is_navigation_finished()` accounts for
## a target that is unreachable or partially reachable; a hand-rolled `distance < 0.5` reports
## "not there yet" forever when a waypoint ends up inside a wall, and the NPC pushes at it until
## someone notices months later.
##
## OWNS: its state, its current waypoint, its movement, and its saved position.
## MUST NOT: know what any waypoint means, contain a route, read player input, draw itself, or
## decide what time it is. `CharacterVisual` draws it, unchanged from the player.

## Which schedule to follow. Empty means this NPC stands where it was placed, which is a valid
## thing to be - a shopkeeper behind a counter needs no route.
