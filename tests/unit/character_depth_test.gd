extends TestCase
## Attributes and surfaces: what a character is LIKE, what they are standing on, and the one
## consumer that turns the first into something the player can feel.
##
## WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, and it is most of a footstep. A step needs a physics frame and
## makes a sound, and `TestCase.run()` is synchronous while `--headless` runs the Dummy audio
## driver — so the raycast, the frame loop and the `play()` are proved by a windowed probe with
## the log quoted in `DEVLOG.md`, exactly the split `SurfaceWetness` made for drying. What IS
## here is the three pure parts underneath: how often a step falls (`travel`), what is underfoot
## (`GroundSurface.of_node`) and what that sounds like (`brightness_for`). If those three are
## right, the untested remainder is a raycast and a `play()` call.
##
## FIXTURES, NOT THE DEMO. Both surfaces below are abstract names built here on bare nodes;
## nothing in this file names a courtyard, a floor or a material, and `check_boundary` scans it.
##
## OWNS: assertions about the attribute container, its one consumer, surface resolution and the
## stride accumulator.
## MUST NOT: re-assert flag save arithmetic (core_test) or how fast the body actually moves
## across a floor, which no assertion can see.

## Abstract on purpose. `FixtureContent`'s rule: if a name in a test describes a place, that is
