## The export seam: what an assertion running under res:// CAN honestly say about a build it is
## not running in.
##
## WHAT THIS CASE CANNOT DO, SAID FIRST SO NOBODY MISREADS A GREEN RUN
## It cannot test an exported build. It runs from res:// in the editor, where every content file
## is plainly on disk — which is exactly the blind spot T2.0 existed to close, and the reason the
## proof itself is a RUN of the exported executable with its numbers quoted in docs/DEVLOG.md
## rather than an assertion here. _the_suite_is_not_an_exported_build() asserts that blindness
## instead of leaving it implied, so this file cannot quietly start looking like the proof.
##
## WHAT IT CAN DO, AND ALL THREE ARE LOAD-BEARING
## 1. Pin the preset field the whole content pipeline rests on. ItemDb, DialogueDb and ScheduleDb
##    find content by SCANNING a directory (ADR-0006), so those resources are nobody's dependency
##    and only export_filter="all_resources" ships them. Measured both ways in T2.0. A consuming
##    game that narrows it now fails rung 4 instead of shipping empty catalogues.
## 2. Prove the reporter agrees with the registries. The exported run is read through
##    CatalogueReport, so a reporter that printed a stale or invented number would make the proof
##    worthless — and it would look identical.
## 3. Prove every path the scan resolves actually loads. A PARTIAL ship is worse than an empty
##    one, because three of four items is a plausible number.
##
## OWNS: assertions about the export contract and the catalogue readout.
## MUST NOT: assert what the registries themselves do — items_test.gd, dialogue_test.gd and
## npc_test.gd own the catalogues. This case owns only the seam to the build.
