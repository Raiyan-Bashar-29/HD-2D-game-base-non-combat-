class_name Interactable
extends Area3D
## The contract every interactable object in the game satisfies. Subclass it, override two
## methods, and the sensor, the prompt and the refusal messaging all work with no further code.
##
## WHY A THIN BASE CLASS AND NOT A COMPONENT
## Composition is the default in this project, but interaction needs a *typed* contract: the
## sensor has to ask "can I?" and "do it" on an unknown object, and warnings-as-errors forbids
## calling a method on an untyped value. A duck-typed component would need casts at every call
## site. One shallow base class, with behaviour and state pushed into children, gets the type
## safety without an inheritance tree. Subclasses must stay thin.
##
## TO ADD A NEW KIND OF INTERACTABLE:
##     extends Interactable
##     func refusal(who: Node3D) -> GameEnums.RefusalReason:   # optional
##     func perform(who: Node3D) -> void:                       # the actual effect
##
## Everything else - detection, ranking, the prompt, the refusal toast, one-shot handling,
## hold-to-confirm - is already handled.
##
## OWNS: its own eligibility and effect, and its prompt text.
## MUST NOT: know who is interacting beyond a Node3D, reach for the player directly, or drive
## the UI. It answers questions and performs an effect; the sensor and the UI observe.

## Shown on the prompt. Presentational only; `perform()` decides what actually happens.
@export var verb: GameEnums.InteractVerb = GameEnums.InteractVerb.LOOK
## Localization key for the object's name, e.g. "object.sign.gate.label". Never raw text.
@export var label_key: String = ""
## Breaks ties when several objects overlap. Higher wins before distance is considered.
## NOT named `priority`: Area3D already defines that natively, for physics/audio override
## ordering, and redefining it is a parse error.
@export var interact_priority: int = 0
## Set false to make the object present but inert, e.g. a door sealed by the plot.
@export var available: bool = true
## After a successful interaction, stop offering it. For a note you only read once.
@export var one_shot: bool = false
## Identity for persistence, forwarded to the PersistentState child. Exported here so an
## instanced object scene sets its id with one root-level override, instead of an edit to a
## child node that hand-authored scenes cannot express robustly.
@export var object_id: StringName = &""
## Above zero, the player must hold the button this long. For deliberate or dangerous actions.
@export_range(0.0, 3.0, 0.05) var hold_seconds: float = 0.0

## Emitted after a successful interaction. Local listeners only; the bus carries the
## global announcement.
signal interacted(who: Node3D)
## Emitted when this object's eligibility changes, so the sensor can re-rank immediately.
