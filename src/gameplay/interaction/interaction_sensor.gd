class_name InteractionSensor
extends Area3D
## Finds what the player could interact with, decides which one they mean, and fires it.
## Lives as a child of the player.
##
## THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
## Detection is trivial; *selection* is not. Stand where a sign, a lever and a door all
## overlap and the game must pick the one the player means, let them override it, and never
## silently swap the target while they are reaching for the button. Nearest-wins is not enough:
## a player facing a lever with a sign fractionally closer will press the button and read the
## sign, which reads as a bug.
##
## The ranking is: priority first (authored intent wins), then proximity, then how squarely
## the player is facing it. Ties are broken by node name so the order is stable frame to
## frame rather than dependent on physics callback order.
##
## OWNS: the candidate set, the ranking, the cycle override, hold timing, and the MOMENT the
## player is asked to turn towards what they have selected.
## MUST NOT: know what any interactable does, or contain any object's behaviour. It asks for a
## turn on `Events.turn_requested` naming the body it hangs under; it does not know that body
## has a sprite, a sheet or a facing, and must not learn.
##
## NOTE ON INPUT: this reads input directly. It is a component of the player, and the
## alternative - routing interaction input through PlayerController - would force the
## controller to know about interaction, which its own MUST NOT line forbids.

## THE CONSUMER OF `accessibility/hold_to_confirm`, and the only file that could be. What an
## interaction COSTS in input is this component's business: `Interactable.hold_seconds` is the
## author's per-object answer, and this setting is the player's floor under all of them.
const HOLD_TO_CONFIRM: String = "accessibility/hold_to_confirm"

## PUBLIC, AND FOR THE REASON `is_suspended()` IS. The cycle used to live inline in
## `_handle_input`, reachable only by pressing Tab — and the suite is synchronous, so it cannot
## press anything: `Input.parse_input_event` is buffered until a main-loop flush that never
## comes mid-run, and `Input.action_press` does land but leaves the action reading
## `is_action_just_pressed() == true` for the whole run, because the process-frame counter never
## advances inside one `_ready()`. That stuck key then cycles every OTHER case's sensor. So the
## override that every overlapping object rests on was unassertable, and said so in
## `interaction_test.gd`'s own MUST NOT line for four phases. The key binding is still proved
## windowed, by `dev_stage.gd --cycle`; this is the decision it makes.

## flicker and buy nothing. And a player crossing a courtyard past a row of objects should keep
## facing where they are going rather than snapping at each one as it takes the prompt.
##
## THE SENSOR ASKS, IT DOES NOT TURN. It emits `Events.turn_requested` naming the body it hangs
## under and lets whatever draws that body answer, so this file still knows nothing about a
