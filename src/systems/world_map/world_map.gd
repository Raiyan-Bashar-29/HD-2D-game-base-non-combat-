## What the player knows of the world, and the one way anything asks to fast travel.
##
## DISCOVERY IS A FLAG, AND IT OWNS NO STORE. A known area is:
##     map/<area id>          -> true
## which is `PersistentState`'s `obj/<area>/<object>/<field>`, `Standing`'s `standing/<who>` and
## `Equipment`'s `equip/<wearer>/<item>` applied to a FOURTH case. The same three consequences
## fall out, and together they are the whole argument against a discovery store with a save
## section of its own:
##
##   1. IT IS ALREADY SAVED. No `SaveSystem.register`, no save version, no migration — and a
##      new game clears it for free, because `Director.start_new_game()` clears flags. That is
##      what makes "discovery survives a save and a reload, from the far side of an area that
##      is no longer loaded" true without a line of code here: the flag never lived in the area.
##   2. ANYTHING CAN REVEAL AN AREA WITH NO CODE. A `DialogueChoice` effect, a `TriggerVolume`,
##      a `Lever`, a `QuestStep`'s consequence — anything that writes `map/<id>` puts a place on
##      the map, and none of them has heard of this file. A rumour in a conversation and walking
##      through the door are the same mechanism. Equally, a `Gate` may require `map/<id>`.
##   3. IT IS ANNOUNCED ALREADY. `flag_changed` fires, so a quest that tests "have you found the
##      orchard" progresses with no code at all.
##
## The cost is stated rather than hidden: the key contains an area id, so renaming an area's
## folder makes an existing save forget it was found. That is the same price `Equipment` pays
## for an item id, and it is smaller than the alternative, which writes the same id into a save
## section of its own anyway.
##
## `area_discovered` EXISTS FOR A UI, NOT FOR A RULE. Nothing needs it to gate anything, for
## reason 3 above. It is here so a screen can redraw a dot — gotcha 34, which is the rule that a
## UI subscribes to the FACT and never only to its own input.
##
## A NODE, NOT AN AUTOLOAD. Adding an autoload requires an ADR and this would buy nothing: no
## init-order requirement, no interface the boot scene cannot give it. It sits under `GameRoot`
## beside `QuestTracker`, so it outlives every area, and it is found by GROUP the way `UiRoot`
## and `QuestTracker` are, so a tool or a test can run without one.
##
## OWNS: the discovery key shape, turning arrival into discovery, and the fast-travel ask.
## MUST NOT: keep a copy of what is discovered, load an area, fade anything, move the player, or
## decide what an area contains.

## The group this node joins, so a screen finds it without a hard path. Same mechanism, and the
## same reason, as `UiRoot.GROUP` and `QuestTracker.GROUP`.
