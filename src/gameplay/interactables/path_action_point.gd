class_name PathActionPoint
extends Interactable
## One path action, offered on one person. A `Speaker` you can scrutinise instead of talk to.
##
## ONE NODE PER ACTION, AND NO MENU. An NPC offering three actions is three overlapping
## `Interactable`s, which the player selects between with the ranking and Tab-cycling the
## interaction sensor has had since Phase 0 — the exact case its header describes as "stand
## where a sign, a lever and a door all overlap and the game must pick the one the player
## means". A path-action menu would be a second selection mechanism competing with that one,
## with its own focus handling and its own screen, to solve a problem already solved.
##
## STANDING IS READ FROM THE PERSON, NOT FROM THIS NODE. `standing_id` names the NPC, so three
## actions on one keeper all move the same number, and moving that keeper to another area does
## not reset it. This node holds no standing of its own for the same reason a `Gate` holds no
## inventory: the fact belongs to whoever it is about.
##
## OWNS: offering one action, refusing it, and applying its outcome.
## MUST NOT: contain the action's data (that is the `.tres`), decide what standing means, draw
## anything, or know that a dialogue box exists.

## The authored action. Without one this node refuses everything and says so at load.
@export var action: PathAction = null
## Which person's standing this action reads and moves. Usually the NPC that owns this node.
@export var standing_id: StringName = &""

const DONE_FIELD: StringName = &"done"

## Emitted after the action resolves, with whether it succeeded. Local listeners only; the bus
## carries the flag change and the toast.
