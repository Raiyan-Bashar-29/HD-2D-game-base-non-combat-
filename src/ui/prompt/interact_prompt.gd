## The interaction prompt. Shows the verb and the object's name, and the refusal reason when
## the player is turned down.
##
## Every string here goes through `tr()`. There is no path in this file by which raw
## player-facing text can reach the screen, which is the point: the previous project
## accumulated ~200 hard-coded strings because the easy path was the wrong one.
##
## OWNS: the prompt text and its visibility.
## MUST NOT: decide what can be interacted with, or perform an interaction. It renders what
## the sensor announces.

## Seconds a refusal message stays up before the normal prompt returns.

## THE TWO SETTINGS THIS LABEL CONSUMES, named here because this is the only file that can.
## `gameplay/show_interact_hints` is a preference about the PROMPT, and this node is the prompt;
## `accessibility/high_contrast_prompts` is a preference about how the prompt READS, and the
## outline it turns on is a property of this Label. Neither had a consumer before T5.5, and both
## were drawn to the player and translated in both languages the whole time.
const HINTS_SETTING: String = "gameplay/show_interact_hints"

## Outline width in pixels when high contrast is on. THREE VALUES WERE PHOTOGRAPHED and this is
## the one that survived, which is the only way to pick a number like this: at 6 the outline
## swamped the glyphs of an 18px font and the crop was HARDER to read than the plain prompt -
## the opposite of what the setting is for - and at 2 it was invisible against the courtyard's
## bright grass. At 4 the halo separates the text from the ground and the letterforms survive.
const OUTLINE_PIXELS: int = 4
