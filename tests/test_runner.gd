extends Node
## Rung 4 of the verification ladder: headless integration tests with the real autoloads live.
## This file is a dispatcher. The assertions live in tests/unit/, one file per area.
##
## RUN:
##     godot_console --headless res://tests/test_runner.tscn --quit-after 400
##
## Exit code 0 if every assertion passes, 1 otherwise, so this gates a commit or CI.
##
## WHY THIS IS A SCENE AND NOT A --script TOOL
## Under `--headless --script foo.gd` the autoload *nodes* are created, but the autoload
## *identifiers* (Log, Flags, SaveSystem) fail to compile - proven, the error is
## `Compile Error: Identifier not found: Log`. So no test that touches a system can be a
## --script tool. It has to be a scene, entered positionally.
##
## WHY THE SUITE IS SPLIT
## This file reached 184 of its 250 code lines with its largest case at 35 of the 40 allowed
## per function. Rather than raise the budget - the move that turns a file into 3,983 lines
## twenty reasonable lines at a time - the cases moved into tests/unit/ behind a TestCase base.
##
## THE FOUR WAYS A SUITE PASSES WITHOUT TESTING ANYTHING, and what stops each (T1.3):
## 1. A case CRASHES. A GDScript runtime error aborts only the innermost frame, so the runner
##    sees a case that returned normally. Caught TWICE, because one is not enough: the declared
##    plan catches every crash that swallows an assertion, and `ErrorWatch` - an `OS.add_logger`
##    Logger counting ERROR_TYPE_SCRIPT - catches the rest, including a crash in a leaf helper
##    with nothing asserted after it, which the plan provably does not see.
## 2. A case RETURNS EARLY, or a block is commented out. Same plan, same shortfall.
## 3. A case asserts NOTHING. A plan of zero, or no plan at all, is a failure here.
## 4. A FILE IS NEVER RUN because nobody added it to CASES. `_manifest_is_complete()` scans the
##    directory and fails on a file that exists and is not listed. Gotcha 22 is this failure
##    one layer down: a file that does not parse is invisible to a green run.
##
## OWNS: discovering cases, tallying them, enforcing the plans and the exit code.
## MUST NOT: contain assertions of its own, or any game logic.
