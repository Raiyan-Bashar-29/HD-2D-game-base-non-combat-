## Photographs the MOMENT a scripted scenario produces. The fifth debug file, and it exists
## because three consecutive packages closed with the same admission: a feature was proved by
## assertion and by reading the code, and never once photographed happening in a real session.
##
## WHY A FIFTH FILE RATHER THAN A FLAG ON dev_probes.gd
## Two reasons, and the second is the real one. `dev_probes.gd` is at 205 of its 250 code lines
## and `dev_stage.gd` at 248, so neither has room for a probe that both drives a scenario AND
## owns a shutter. But the seam was already there: `dev_probes.gd` answers "does sequence Y
## work" and prints a NUMBER, `dev_capture.gd` answers "what does the game look like under
## condition X" and shoots at a FRAME NUMBER, and neither can photograph a moment that exists
## for six tenths of a second and only after a scripted sequence has produced it. That is this
## file's question, and it is the same question `dev_gait_shots.gd` asks about a walk cycle -
## which is why the shutter here takes that file's shape rather than a new one.
##
## AUTOMATED USE - everything after the bare `--` is passed to the game:
##
##   --gate-shot=<dir>    throw the demo's north-gate lever, open the gate, and photograph the
##                        screen shake THE GATE asked for. `dev_capture.gd`'s `--shake=` emits
##                        the same signal a gate emits, so what it photographs is the rig; this
##                        photographs the WIRE, because nothing here touches a camera or a
##                        signal - it presses the interact key. Writes gate_closed.png (the
##                        control, camera at rest), gate_shake.png (the frame of greatest
##                        displacement) and gate_open.png (settled again, the leaf gone), and
##                        logs the camera's distance from rest in metres on every frame between.
##   --autosave-write     pose a state a fresh game is not in, then TRAVEL, so the autosave is
##                        written by `Events.area_entered` and not by this probe. Run it with
##                        `--new-game`. Reports what was posed and whether the file appeared.
##   --autosave-continue=<dir>
##                        the other half, in a FRESH PROCESS and with no `--new-game`: boot to
##                        the main menu, photograph the Continue row the autosave put there,
##                        press it through a focused Button and a real `ui_accept`, and
##                        photograph where the game came back. Compare the two reports line for
##                        line - that comparison is the measurement, and the pictures are what
##                        say it reached a screen.
##
## THE PAIR IS TWO PROCESSES FOR `--save-state`'s REASON, stated in dev_probes.gd and true here:
## an in-process reload cannot tell a value that was written to disk and read back from one that
## was simply never cleared. What this pair adds to that one is the OCCASION and the DOOR - the
## autosave is written by a real arrival and read by the real Continue row, neither of which
## `--save-state` touches.
##
## READ THE LOG AND THE PICTURE TOGETHER, gotcha 64's discipline: the metres in the log are the
## measurement of the shake and the image is the corroboration, never the other way round.
##
## OWNS: driving a scenario to the moment worth photographing, and opening the shutter on it.
## MUST NOT: be depended upon by gameplay, pose a camera offset or a save file by hand, or
## reimplement anything it photographs. Deleting this file must not break the game.

## Frames to let the boot transition settle. Same wait, same reason, as every probe in this
## project: gotcha 9.
const SETTLE_FRAMES: int = 30
## Frames to sample the camera for after the gate opens. `Gate.SHAKE_SECONDS` is 0.6, so at 60 Hz

## any authored cluster in this template.
const CYCLE_TRIES: int = 6
## Per-frame camera movement below which the rig counts as parked, in metres. `follow_lag` is
## exponential, so it approaches its target and never arrives; this is small enough that the
## remainder is four orders of magnitude under the shake being measured.
const STILL_METRES: float = 0.00001
## Frames to give the rig to park before the control shot. THE SECOND DEFECT THE FIRST RUN FOUND:
