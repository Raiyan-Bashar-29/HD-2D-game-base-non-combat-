## The dialogue runner: conditions, branching, effects, and what happens to a conversation that
## is saved in the middle.
##
## THE HEADLINE ASSERTION IS _the_whole_exit_criterion(). One conversation that reads a flag,
## branches on it, sets another, and is then saved mid-line — which is the WP-05 criterion
## verbatim, walked in one go rather than inferred from four separate cases.
##
## Driven through the runner directly, never through the screen: `TestCase.run()` is
## synchronous, so a typewriter reveal that needs frames cannot be asserted here. What the box
## draws is proved by a windowed capture instead.
##
## OWNS: assertions about conversation data, condition evaluation, branching and effects.
## MUST NOT: assert what the dialogue box looks like, or re-assert the input lock. ui_test.gd
## owns the lock, and the capture owns the look.
