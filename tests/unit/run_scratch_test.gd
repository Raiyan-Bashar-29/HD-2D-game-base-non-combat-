extends TestCase
## Whether a suite run writes only inside its own directory, and cleans up the dead runs' ones.
##
## WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. The defect was two PROCESSES, and one process cannot be two.
## So this asserts the two facts the isolation rests on: every scratch path the suite hands out
## is inside `RunScratch.root()`, and two pids never share a root. The isolation itself was
## proved by running two suites at once, before and after, in DEVLOG.md's T6.13 entry.
##
## PRUNING IS DRIVEN WITH A THRESHOLD THIS CASE SUPPLIES, because nothing can age a heartbeat
## file, and IN A PARENT OF ITS OWN, because a doctored prune aimed at the shared parent is the
## defect again. The real threshold is exercised too: under it, a fresh heartbeat survives.
##
## OWNS: assertions about `RunScratch` and about every suite scratch path living under it.
## MUST NOT: assert what a save, a fixture or a setting CONTAINS. save_dir_test.gd and
## content_scan_test.gd own those.

## Two run directories this case plants: one whose run has stopped, one whose run has only begun.
