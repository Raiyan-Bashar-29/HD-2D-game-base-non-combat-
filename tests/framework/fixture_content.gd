class_name FixtureContent
extends RefCounted
## The content a test needs, built in code: items, a conversation, a schedule, a quest, a path
## action.
##
## WHY THIS EXISTS
## A test asserting `item/rose_key` is testing the demo, not the item system. Before T1.3 about
## a third of the suite named demo content, so deleting `data/` and `scenes/areas/` - which
## `docs/NEW_GAME.md` tells a consuming game to do on day one - deleted rung 4 of the
## verification ladder. Everything here is deliberately ABSTRACT: `fixture/unique`, not a key
## to a rose garden. If a name in this file ever describes a place, that is the demo growing
## back.
##
## WHY THE SHAPES ARE WHAT THEY ARE
## Each builder reproduces the STRUCTURE the systems under test need, and nothing else. The
## conversation is the clearest case: it has a first-meeting node and an acquaintance node in
## authored order (so the entry-point condition has something to choose between), a branch node
## with exactly three choices (so hiding one can be observed), a node that leads onward and one
## that terminates. That is not a story - it is the smallest graph on which the runner's rules
## are all observable.
##
## OWNS: constructing content resources. MUST NOT: write files, touch a registry, or assert
## anything. `fixtures.gd` owns where content lives; this file owns what it is.

## is the whole of the defect `quest_chain_test.gd` exists for, so it belongs in the names.
##
## Both start on a FLAG rather than on ALWAYS, for the reason `count_quest()` gives: a quest that
## is active in every case which clears the flags would break "nothing is active yet" elsewhere.
