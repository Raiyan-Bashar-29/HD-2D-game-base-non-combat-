extends TestCase
## Schedules: which block covers which hour, and whether a whereabouts survives a save.
##
## WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: walking. A navmesh needs physics frames and `TestCase.run()`
## is synchronous, so no assertion here can watch an NPC cross an area. That is measured by
## a RUN instead — `--npc-day` in `dev_capture.gd` steps the clock through a whole day and
## reports where each NPC actually ends up, and `--npc-storm=30` measures what a crowd costs.
##
## What IS here is everything decidable without a frame, and the part most likely to rot: the
## hour-to-block lookup, which is pure arithmetic over authored data and has exactly the shape
## that silently returns the wrong answer at 03:00 six months from now.
##
## FIXTURES, NOT THE DEMO. The arithmetic runs on `FixtureContent`'s two-block timetable. The
## one block that genuinely needs a game — every waypoint an authored schedule names must exist
## in some authored area — is gated on the demo and skipped loudly without it.
##
## OWNS: assertions about NpcSchedule, ScheduleEntry, ScheduleDb and persisted whereabouts.
## MUST NOT: assert anything about pathing, movement or navmesh baking.

## INEXPRESSIBLE. The fixture is built to make that failure visible rather than arguable: its

## THE COVERAGE GUARANTEE, WHICH T5.32 BROKE AND AN AUDIT CAUGHT RATHER THAN A GATE.
##
## `schedule_entry.gd` promises a day is ALWAYS completely covered, "because an NPC is always
## somewhere", and before `on_day_of_cycle` existed that was structurally true: any entry applied
## on any day, so the wrap-to-last-block fallback could never come up empty. A day-specific entry
## broke it, and nothing noticed — a schedule of only day-specific blocks answered NOTHING on any
## other day while `problems()` returned zero, so `check_content` passed on content that strands
## an NPC. `NpcBrain.decide_for_hour` returns early on a null entry, so the NPC keeps standing
## wherever it happened to be: the "reads as random" failure that header exists to prevent.
##
## ONE ENTRY AT `-1` IS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT, which is why that is the rule rather than
## "every day of the cycle is covered". The stronger rule would need `Clock.days_per_cycle`, and
## `content` may not touch an autoload. This asserts both halves: that the rule is enforced, and
