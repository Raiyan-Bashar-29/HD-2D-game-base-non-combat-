extends TestCase
## The world map: where a place sits, how it becomes known, and the one ask that travels.
##
## WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the travel itself. `TestCase.run()` is synchronous and a
## threaded load needs frames, so what is asserted is `WorldMap.travel_to`'s SEAM — that it emits
## exactly the request an `AreaDoor` emits, naming the area and the authored arrival spawn, and
## does nothing else at all. Driving a transition is a RUN, not an assertion, for the reason
## `transitions_test.gd` gives at length. Pressing `M` is a windowed probe, gotcha 15.
##
## DISCOVERY IS ASSERTED AS A FLAG, WHICH IS THE PACKAGE. There is no save section to test,
## because there is no store: `map/<area id>` goes through `Flags`, so the reload block below
## asserts that a flag coming back through `SaveSystem` makes the map report the place known
## again. That is a smaller claim than "the discovery system persists" and it is the true one.
##
## AREAS ARE DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED, in the demo block at the foot — `Fixtures.area_ids()` scans
## `scenes/areas/`, so the contract covers area three the day it appears and covers nothing at
## all in a stripped template, reported as a skip rather than as a pass. Every other block runs
## on `FixtureContent.area_defs()`, which has no scenes behind it on purpose: the map is provable
## in a checkout with no game in it.
##
## OWNS: assertions about `AreaDef`, `AreaDb` and `WorldMap`, and about the authored map agreeing
## with the authored areas.
## MUST NOT: drive a transition, assert what the map LOOKS like, or name demo content.
