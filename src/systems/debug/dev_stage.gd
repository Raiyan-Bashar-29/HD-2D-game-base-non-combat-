## Staging: put the game into the state a photograph needs, then get out of the way.
##
## THE SEAM, AND WHY THERE ARE NOW THREE DEBUG FILES
## `dev_capture.gd` answers "what does the game LOOK like under condition X" and owns the
## shutter. `dev_probes.gd` answers "does sequence Y actually work" and owns the measurements.
## This file answers "put the player THERE, holding THAT, with THIS person feeling THAT way" so
## the other two have something worth looking at. All three were one file until the budget
## checker refused it twice, at 310 and then at 320 of the 250 allowed code lines — and both
## times the seam it exposed was already there in the reasoning. That is the tool working.
##
## EVERY FLAG HERE GOES THROUGH THE REAL PATH. Standing is set through `Flags` on the key
## `Standing` publishes, an interaction is a real `InputEventAction` through
## `Input.parse_input_event`, a conversation opens through the same bus signal a `Speaker`
## emits. A staging tool that reached past the game to pose it would photograph a mock.
##
## THE FLAGS RUN CONCURRENTLY, and each waits a different number of frames before acting, which
## is what orders them: --stand-by settles first, --cycle after it, --interact last. That is
## fragile if a fourth is added; add it with a longer wait than the one it must follow.
##
## EVERYTHING AFTER THE BARE `--` IS PASSED TO THE GAME:
##
##   --give=<list>        put items in the player's bag: item/rose_key,item/rose_petal:3. After
##                        the area lands, because a new game now empties the bag - gotcha 32.
##                        This also poses a counted quest step, since a count is a flag.
##   --equip=<list>       put items IN HAND, after the area lands: --equip=item/lantern. The
##                        carrier must already hold them, so --give comes first on the line.
##                        Equipment is a flag, and --new-game clears flags — see gotcha 32.
##   --open-inventory     push the inventory screen over a stopped world. Apply --give first,
##                        or the capture shows an empty bag.
##   --talk=<id>          open a conversation: --talk=talk/gardener
##   --talk-advance=<n>   press through n lines, to capture a branch rather than the opening.
##   --goto=<area>        travel somewhere else once the boot load has settled.
##   --stand-by=<name>    put the player beside a named node and let the sensor settle on it.
##   --flag=<key>:<value> forge a plot flag AFTER the area lands: --flag=met/someone:true,
##                        --flag=count/lit:3. --new-game clears flags, so it cannot be earlier.
##                        A quest step is a flag condition, so this poses quest progress.
##   --standing=<who>:<n> set someone's standing, to photograph an action refused, failing and
##                        succeeding without playing the twenty minutes it takes to earn it.
##   --cycle=<n>          press the cycle key n times, to select past the first of several
##                        overlapping targets. An NPC with two path actions and a conversation
##                        is three overlapping interactables.
##   --interact=<n>       press the interact key n times, so a capture shows the OUTCOME of an
##                        action rather than only its prompt. A refusal, a failure and a
##                        success look identical until the button is pressed.
##   --new-game           start a game. Since WP-12 the boot goes to the main menu, not to an
##                        area, so without this there is no world to photograph.
##   --open-menu=<list>   push menus by name, innermost last: main_menu, pause, settings,
##                        saves, controls, journal, map. `--open-menu=pause,settings` puts
##                        settings over the pause menu, and `--goto=X --open-menu=map` shows the
##                        map from X.
##   --npc-settle=<n>     let NPCs walk for n physics frames, so a screenshot shows them AT
##                        their posts rather than halfway there.
##   --console=<lines>    open the debug console and run lines through it, separated by ';':
##                        --console="time 18:40;flag met/someone:true". The lines go through
##                        DebugConsoleScreen.submit(), which is the same path the enter key
##                        takes, so a capture shows a real transcript. Waits for the world to
##                        stay still - gotcha 35, this puts something on screen.
