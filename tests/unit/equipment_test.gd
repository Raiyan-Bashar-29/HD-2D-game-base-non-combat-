## Equipment: what a carrier holds READY, the slot exclusivity, and the seam that lets a gate
## require it with no code at all. Also the two authored refusal lines that were declared,
## validated and read by nothing until this package.
##
## WHY THERE IS NO SAVE-SECTION BLOCK HERE and there is one in pickups_test: `Equipment` owns no
## dictionary. Every slot is a flag, so the save round trip is `Flags`', which core_test already
## covers. What is asserted below is the part that could still be wrong — that a flag arriving
## back through a load makes the component report the item held again, and that revalidation on
## the same load does not stow it on the way past.
##
## FIXTURES, NOT THE DEMO. Three equippable fixture items, two of them sharing a slot, and the
## traversal proof is a `Gate` built here with an abstract object id. Nothing in this file names
## a lantern, an arch or an area, and `check_boundary` scans it.
##
## OWNS: assertions about equipping, slots, equipment-gated traversal, and the authored refusal.
## MUST NOT: re-assert inventory arithmetic (items_test) or how a screen draws a row
## (screens_test).
