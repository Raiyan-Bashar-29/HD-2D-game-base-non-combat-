extends TestCase
## The menus as SCREENS: what each one offers, what raises it, and what closes it.
##
## THE HEADLINE ASSERTION IS _flags_are_declared_in_init(). `StubScreen` once set its flags in
## `_build`, which runs from `_ready` - i.e. after a caller has had its chance to override one -
## and that made the overlay assertion in ui_test.gd pass vacuously for a whole package. Every
## screen this package adds is checked against it twice: on a fresh instance that has never been
## built, and again through an override that has to survive being built.
##
## THE SECOND IS _travel_unwinds_the_stack(). No screen in this game closes the stack it is
## standing on; `ScreenKeys` does it once, for every screen, on `area_change_requested`. If that
## ever stops working, a menu survives a transition and sits over an area that no longer exists,
## which is exactly the bug WP-04 spent a package finding in the interaction prompt.
##
## Driven by direct calls, never by simulated input: TestCase.run() is synchronous, so an input
## event never reaches the frame that would deliver it.
##
## THIS CASE OWNS user://saves FOR THE RUN. It empties every slot at set-up, because "a first
## run offers no Continue" is not assertable while a slot exists, and empties them again after.
##
## OWNS: assertions about menu rows, what raises a menu, and slot headers.
## MUST NOT: re-assert the pause table or the input lock (ui_test.gd), what the inventory
## renders (screens_test.gd), or how a setting or a binding changes (options_test.gd).
