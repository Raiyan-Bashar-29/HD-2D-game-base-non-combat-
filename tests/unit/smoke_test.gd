## The smoke test: ONE continuous session driving the systems through their PUBLIC APIs, in the
## order a game drives them, asserting that the whole run left the log clean.
##
## THE ROW ASKED FOR "A SMOKE TEST THAT DRIVES THE WHOLE DEMO", AND THIS DELIBERATELY DRIVES A
## GAME INSTEAD. WP-14 was written before the template reframing and its wording would have
## welded the courtyard, the garden-keeper and the rose key into a permanent gate — the exact
## coupling `tools/check_boundary.gd` exists to prevent, arriving through the back door of a
## test. T1.3 already unwelded the suite from the demo once; a smoke test naming demo content
## would have grown it straight back, and the gate would have caught it, because
## `check_boundary` scans `tests/unit/`. So the session below is built from
## `tests/framework/fixtures.gd` and names no content at all. The board row was rewritten in
## the same commit rather than quietly reinterpreted — see docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md § WP-14.
##
## WHAT A SMOKE TEST CAN BE HERE, given that `run()` is SYNCHRONOUS (TESTING.md rule 2). It
## cannot travel between areas, wait on the threaded loader or press a key, so "end to end" is
## not "boot to credits". It is the CHAIN: a run begins, a quest starts because a flag was
## written, items are gathered and publish their counts, a counted objective notices, something
## is put in hand, time passes, the whole lot is saved, wiped and restored, and the quest is
## still where it was. Every one of those seams has its own case; this asserts they compose,
## which is the one thing a per-system case cannot see.
##
## WHY THE TALLY IS A DELTA AND NOT `Log.tally() == Vector2i(0, 0)`, which is what the row's
## exit criterion literally says. Measured: a full suite run ends `14 warnings, 8 errors`,
## because several cases assert refusals and bad input ON PURPOSE. `tally()` is cumulative over
## the session, so the absolute form would assert something about the cases that happened to run
## first. The delta across this case is the claim actually worth making, and it is the stronger
## one: driving a game through this chain must produce neither a warning nor an error.
##
## OWNS: the composed session, and the assertion that it logged nothing.
## MUST NOT: name authored content, or re-assert a single system's behaviour — the per-system
## cases own that, and duplicating it here would make this file fail for their reasons.

## The FIXTURE carrier, not one of our own: the fixture counted step names
## `BagKeys.key(CARRIER, STACK_ITEM)`, so a bag published under any other id is invisible to it.
## Found by assertion rather than by reading the fixture — the first run of this case reported
## `expected (2, 3), got (0, 3)` with the flag provably set, which is what a carrier mismatch
## looks like from the outside.
